  {"id":"ahnClinicalRecommendationsDefining2016","abstract":"Toxicities resulting from platinum based chemotherapy in head and neck cancer is a cause for much concern. There is a lack of clinical criteria for defining these patient populations, which has posed serious problems associated with increased morbidity and consequently an adverse effect on patients’ quality of life. In addition, there is a lack of consensus on clinical criteria for defining such patient populations, who may be unsuitable for concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A group of experts in the field of head and neck cancer from the Asia Pacific Region convened in August 2014 in Korea to discuss the development of a set of clinical criteria in order to fill the knowledge gap and provide a reference tool for head and neck oncologists. This paper reports the final output from this meeting and the accompanying literature review, with the aim of aiding clinical decision making with the help of some clinical criteria to identify platinum unsuitable patient populations in head and neck cancer management. Some alternative treatment options are also discussed in this paper.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahn","given":"Myung-Ju"},{"family":"D’Cruz","given":"Anil"},{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jo-Pai"},{"family":"Chitapanarux","given":"Imjai"},{"family":"Dang","given":"Huy Quoc Thinh"},{"family":"Guminski","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Kannarunimit","given":"Danita"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Tong-Yu"},{"family":"Ng","given":"Wai Tong"},{"family":"Park","given":"Keon-Uk"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Anthony Tak Cheung"}],"citation-key":"ahnClinicalRecommendationsDefining2016","container-title":"Oral Oncology","container-title-short":"Oral Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/j.oraloncology.2015.11.019","ISSN":"1368-8375","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,2,1]]},"language":"en","page":"10-16","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Clinical recommendations for defining platinum unsuitable head and neck cancer patient populations on chemoradiotherapy: A literature review","title-short":"Clinical recommendations for defining platinum unsuitable head and neck cancer patient populations on chemoradiotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1368837515003978","volume":"53"},
  {"id":"alsubhiSystematicReviewIncidence2022","abstract":"Context: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are known to be rare. However, there is scant literature reporting their epidemiology, particularly whether the diagnosis of PPGL has increased with advances in medical imaging and biochemical and genetic testing.\nObjective: The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine the annual incidence of PPGLs and change over time.\nDesign: A systematic review was performed. Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched to identify studies reporting PPGL incidence. Studies were eligible for inclusion from the database's inception until August 30, 2021.\nResults: A total of 6109 manuscripts were identified; 2282 duplicates were excluded, and a further 3815 papers were excluded after abstract and/or full text review. Twelve studies were included in the final review. The incidence of PPGL ranged from 0.04 to 0.95 cases per 100 000 per year. Incidence increased over time, from approximately 0.2/100,000 individuals in studies performed before 2000, to approximately 0.6/100,000 in studies undertaken after 2010. The mode of diagnosis changed over the same time period, with more patients diagnosed from incidental imaging findings, and fewer at autopsy or from symptoms.\nConclusion: The annual incidence of PPGL has increased over time. Much of this increase is likely from incidental identification of tumors on imaging. However, the epidemiology of PPGL remains understudied, in particular, in associations with altitude, ethnicity, and genetics. To improve early detection and management guidelines, these gaps should be addressed.","author":[{"family":"Al Subhi","given":"Abdul Rahman"},{"family":"Boyle","given":"Veronica"},{"family":"Elston","given":"Marianne S."}],"citation-key":"alsubhiSystematicReviewIncidence2022","container-title":"Journal of the Endocrine Society","container-title-short":"J Endocr Soc","DOI":"10.1210/jendso/bvac105","ISSN":"2472-1972","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"bvac105","PMCID":"PMC9334688","PMID":"35919261","source":"PubMed","title":"Systematic Review: Incidence of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Over 70 Years","title-short":"Systematic Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1210%2Fjendso%2Fbvac105","volume":"6"},

  {"id":"dasChemotherapyNeuroendocrineTumors2021","abstract":"The role for cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) remains debated. Compared to patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) where chemotherapy is utilized ubiquitously, chemotherapy may play a more select role in patients with certain types of NETs (e.g., pancreatic tumors, higher grade tumors, and tumors possessing DNA damage repair defects). The primary types of chemotherapy that have been tested in patients with NETs include alkylating agent- and platinum agent-based combinations. Across regimens, chemotherapy appears to elicit greater antitumor activity in patients with pancreatic or grade 3 NETs. The role for chemotherapy in lower grade extra-pancreatic NETs remains undefined. Furthermore, while chemotherapy has demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit for patients in the systemic setting, its role in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is as-of-yet undetermined. Finally, efforts to combine chemotherapy with targeted therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are ongoing, in hopes of improving the cytoreductive treatment options for patients with NETs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Das","given":"Satya"},{"family":"Al-Toubah","given":"Taymeyah"},{"family":"Strosberg","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"dasChemotherapyNeuroendocrineTumors2021","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13194872","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"language":"en","page":"4872","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chemotherapy in Neuroendocrine Tumors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/19/4872","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"dasNovelTherapeuticsPatients2021","abstract":"Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent the most common subtype of NETs. The incidence of all NETs, and specifically GEP NETs, has risen exponentially over the last three decades. Only within the past several years have these tumors been appropriately classified, allowing for meaningful drug development. Broadly, some of the most exciting drug classes being developed for patients with well-differentiated GEP NETs include newer types of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) or combinations which increase the potency of lutetium-177 (\n              177\n              Lu)-Dotatate, novel multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) and immunotherapy modalities, beyond checkpoint inhibitors, which seek to unleash the immune system against NETs. Specifically looking at newer types of PRRT, somatostatin receptor antagonists and alpha-emitter radionuclides each have demonstrated the ability to elicit greater DNA damage than\n              177\n              Lu-Dotatate in preclinical models. Early clinical experiences with each of these agents suggest they may be more cytotoxic than\n              177\n              Lu-Dotatate. Other approaches seeking to build upon the DNA damage created by\n              177\n              Lu-Dotatate include combinations of PRRT with radiosensitizers such as heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, chemotherapy combinations, and triapine. Many of these combinations have just begun to be tested clinically. With regards to novel RTKIs, some of the ones which have demonstrated potent cytoreductive potential include cabozantinib and lenvatinib. Other RTKIs which are further along the clinical development spectrum and have demonstrated benefit in randomized trials include surufatinib and pazopanib. And though single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors have not demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patients with GEP NETs, outside of certain biomarker selected subsets, somatostatin receptor-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and vaccines such as SurVaxM, which targets survivin, represent two means through which NET-directed immunity may be modulated. The potential of these agents, if clinically realized, will likely improve outcomes for patients with well-differentiated GEP NETs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Das","given":"Satya"},{"family":"Dasari","given":"Arvind"}],"citation-key":"dasNovelTherapeuticsPatients2021","container-title":"Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology","container-title-short":"Ther Adv Med Oncol","DOI":"10.1177/17588359211018047","ISSN":"1758-8359, 1758-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","page":"175883592110180","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Novel therapeutics for patients with well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17588359211018047","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"else15YEARSPARAGANGLIOMA2015","abstract":"The last decades have elucidated the genetic basis of pheochromocytoma (PC) and paraganglioma (PGL) (PCPGL)-associated hereditary syndromes. However, the history of these syndromes dates back at least another 150 years. Detailed descriptions by clinicians and pathologists in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the recognition of the PCPGL-associated syndromes von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. In the beginning of the current millennium the molecular basis of the hereditary PGL syndrome was elucidated by the discovery of mutations in genes encoding enzymes of the Krebs cycle, such as succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHx) and other mutations, causing ‘pseudo-hypoxia’ signaling. These recent developments also marked a paradigm shift. It reversed the traditional order of genetic research that historically aimed to define the genetic basis of a known hereditary syndrome but now is challenged with defining the full clinical phenotype associated with a newly defined genetic basis. This challenge underscores the importance to learn from medical history, continue providing support for clinical research, and train physicians with regards to their skills to identify patients with PCPGL-associated syndromes to extend our knowledge of the associated phenotype. This historical overview provides details on the history of the paraganglial system and PCPGL-associated syndromes. As such, it hopefully will not only be an interesting reading for the physician with a historical interest but also emphasize the necessity of ongoing astute individual clinical observations and clinical registries to increase our knowledge regarding the full phenotypic spectrum of these conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Else","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"else15YEARSPARAGANGLIOMA2015","container-title":"Endocrine-Related Cancer","DOI":"10.1530/ERC-15-0221","ISSN":"1351-0088, 1479-6821","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,8,1]]},"language":"en_US","page":"T147-T159","publisher":"Bioscientifica Ltd","section":"Endocrine-Related Cancer","source":"erc.bioscientifica.com","title":"15 YEARS OF PARAGANGLIOMA: Pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma and genetic syndromes: a historical perspective","title-short":"15 YEARS OF PARAGANGLIOMA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://erc.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/erc/22/4/T147.xml","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"ferrariSlipperyRoleInduction2020","abstract":"Chemoradiotherapy as an alternative to surgery can be offered to patients affected by loco-regionally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). Induction chemotherapy is a valid option, supported by few positive trials, but its real efficacy is still a matter of debate. The standard regimen for induction chemotherapy in Europe is a combination of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and reduced dose doses of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m2 day, for five consecutive days) (TPF). It is less toxic and more effective than the historical therapy PF (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days). However, in some studies treatment-related mortality has been reported to be as high as 6%. Therefore, some less toxic combinations, such as a modified TPF regimen and the combination of carboplatin plus paclitaxel have been studied. These regimens are showing promising results but deserve further validation in comparative trials. Furthermore, several trials are underway in order to enhance TPF with immune checkpoints inhibitors. Compared to chemoradiotherapy, induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation was shown to be non-inferior, and it could decrease the distant metastatic progression, especially in high-risk populations. For selected patients, induction chemotherapy could be a strong option. The chemoselective process that leads to immediate surgery for non-responders, the high response rate (complete responses are sometimes observed), and the survival data, are all arguments in favor of induction chemotherapy, if performed in experienced centers involving health professionals in the context of a skilled multidisciplinary team.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Daris"},{"family":"Ghi","given":"Maria Grazia"},{"family":"Franzese","given":"Ciro"},{"family":"Codecà","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Gau","given":"Max"},{"family":"Fayette","given":"Jerome"}],"citation-key":"ferrariSlipperyRoleInduction2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2020.00007","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,1,23]]},"page":"7","PMCID":"PMC6989487","PMID":"32038985","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The Slippery Role of Induction Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer: Myth and Reality","title-short":"The Slippery Role of Induction Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6989487/","volume":"10"},

Main characteristics of patients with MPP were: primary pheochromocytoma in 53% of patients; tumor- or hormone-related symptoms in 57% or 58% of cases; positive plasma or urine hormones in 81% of patients; identification of a mutation in SDHB in 42% of cases. Metastatic sites included bone (64%), lymph node (40%), lung (29%), and liver (26%); mean time between initial and malignancy diagnosis was 43 months (range, 0 to 614). Median follow-up was 68 months and median survival 6.7 years. Using univariate analysis, better survival was associated with head and neck paraganglioma, age &lt;40 years, metanephrines less than fivefold the upper limits of the normal range, and low proliferative index.

  {"id":"jiangDefiningCisplatinEligibility2021","abstract":"The current treatment paradigm for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) consists of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by local definitive therapy, or local definitive therapy alone for cisplatin-ineligible patients. Given that MIBC has a high propensity for distant relapse and is a chemotherapy-sensitive disease, under-utilization of chemotherapy is associated with suboptimal cure rates. Cisplatin eligibility criteria are defined for patients with metastatic bladder cancer by the Galsky criteria, which include creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min. However, consensus is still lacking regarding cisplatin eligibility criteria in the neoadjuvant, curative MIBC setting, which continues to represent a substantial barrier to the standardization of patient care and clinical trial design. Jiang and colleagues accordingly suggest an algorithm for assessing cisplatin eligibility in patients with MIBC. Instead of relying on an absolute renal function threshold, their algorithm emphasizes a multidisciplinary and patient-centred approach. They also propose mitigation strategies to minimize the risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in selected patients with impaired renal function. This new framework is aimed at reducing the inappropriate exclusion of some patients from cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (which leads to under-treatment) and harmonizing clinical trial design, which could lead to improved overall outcomes in patients with MIBC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Di Maria"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Shilpa"},{"family":"Kitchlu","given":"Abhijat"},{"family":"Meraz-Munoz","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"North","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Alimohamed","given":"Nimira S."},{"family":"Blais","given":"Normand"},{"family":"Sridhar","given":"Srikala S."}],"citation-key":"jiangDefiningCisplatinEligibility2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Urology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Urol","DOI":"10.1038/s41585-020-00404-6","ISSN":"1759-4820","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"2","page":"104-114","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Defining cisplatin eligibility in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-020-00404-6","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"kimEpidemiologyPrognosisPheochromocytoma2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) are rare endocrine tumors originating from chromaffin cells. PPGLs are associated with a high mortality rate and several complications. To date, no epidemiological studies have been conducted on PPGLs in Asia. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and prognosis of PPGLs in Korea using nationwide data.\nMETHODS: Using the National Health Insurance Service Database, subjects with a principal diagnosis of PPGLs on two or more occasions between 2003 and 2014 who satisfied the operational definition of PPGLs were included. Incidence, prevalence, complications, metastasis, and mortality were investigated.\nRESULTS: In total, 1048 subjects with a mean age of 47.6±16.1 years were included. There was no sex preponderance. The overall prevalence of PPGLs was 2.13 per 100,000 persons, and the overall age-standardized incidence rate was 0.18 per 100,000 person-years. Malignant PPGLs accounted for 17.7% (185 of 1,048) of cases, and 94 subjects exhibited metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Among initially non-metastatic PPGLs, 9.5% (nine of 954) eventually metastasized after a mean duration of 78.1±41.4 months. The 5-year survival rates for non-metastatic and metastatic PPGLs at diagnosis were 97% and 84%, respectively. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for covariates showed that metastatic PPGLs were associated with a 2.40-fold higher risk of mortality than non-metastatic PPGLs (95% confidence interval, 1.38 to 4.17; P=0.002).\nCONCLUSION: PPGLs are rare in Korea, and the prognosis of these endocrine tumors varies depending on whether they are benign or malignant. This epidemiological study paves the way for further research on PPGLs.","author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Jung Hee"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Hyemi"},{"family":"Noh","given":"Junghyun"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Juneyoung"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sin Gon"}],"citation-key":"kimEpidemiologyPrognosisPheochromocytoma2020","container-title":"Endocrinology and Metabolism (Seoul, Korea)","container-title-short":"Endocrinol Metab (Seoul)","DOI":"10.3803/EnM.2020.35.1.157","ISSN":"2093-5978","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3]]},"language":"eng","page":"157-164","PMCID":"PMC7090309","PMID":"32207276","source":"PubMed","title":"Epidemiology and Prognosis of Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma in Korea: A Nationwide Study Based on the National Health Insurance Service","title-short":"Epidemiology and Prognosis of Pheochromocytoma/Paraganglioma in Korea","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"noltingPersonalizedManagementPheochromocytoma2022","abstract":"Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas are characterized by a unique molecular landscape that allows their assignment to clusters based on underlying genetic alterations. With around 30% to 35% of Caucasian patients (a lower percentage in the Chinese population) showing germline mutations in susceptibility genes, pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas have the highest rate of heritability among all tumors. A further 35% to 40% of Caucasian patients (a higher percentage in the Chinese population) are affected by somatic driver mutations. Thus, around 70% of all patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma can be assigned to 1 of 3 main molecular clusters with different phenotypes and clinical behavior. Krebs cycle/VHL/EPAS1-related cluster 1 tumors tend to a noradrenergic biochemical phenotype and require very close follow-up due to the risk of metastasis and recurrence. In contrast, kinase signaling-related cluster 2 tumors are characterized by an adrenergic phenotype and episodic symptoms, with generally a less aggressive course. The clinical correlates of patients with Wnt signaling-related cluster 3 tumors are currently poorly described, but aggressive behavior seems likely. In this review, we explore and explain why cluster-specific (personalized) management of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma is essential to ascertain clinical behavior and prognosis, guide individual diagnostic procedures (biochemical interpretation, choice of the most sensitive imaging modalities), and provide personalized management and follow-up. Although cluster-specific therapy of inoperable/metastatic disease has not yet entered routine clinical practice, we suggest that informed personalized genetic-driven treatment should be implemented as a logical next step. This review amalgamates published guidelines and expert views within each cluster for a coherent individualized patient management plan.","author":[{"family":"Nölting","given":"Svenja"},{"family":"Bechmann","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Taieb","given":"David"},{"family":"Beuschlein","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Fassnacht","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kroiss","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Eisenhofer","given":"Graeme"},{"family":"Grossman","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Pacak","given":"Karel"}],"citation-key":"noltingPersonalizedManagementPheochromocytoma2022","container-title":"Endocrine Reviews","container-title-short":"Endocr Rev","DOI":"10.1210/endrev/bnab019","ISSN":"1945-7189","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"199-239","PMCID":"PMC8905338","PMID":"34147030","source":"PubMed","title":"Personalized Management of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma","type":"article-journal","volume":"43"},
  {"id":"okanoInductionChemotherapyLocally2021","abstract":"In order to maximize the benefit of induction chemotherapy, practice based on a comprehensive interpretation of a large number of clinical trials, as in this review, is essential. The standard treatment for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is surgery or chemoradiation. However, induction chemotherapy followed by (chemo) radiotherapy may be used in some circumstances. Although many clinical trials of induction chemotherapy have been conducted, a rationale other than to preserve the larynx is still controversial. Selection of this modality should therefore be made with care. The current standard regimen for induction chemotherapy is docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU, but concerns remain about toxicity, cost and the duration of treatment. Regarding treatment after induction chemotherapy, it is also unclear whether radiation alone or chemoradiation is the better option. Furthermore, there is no answer as to what drugs should be used in combination with radiation therapy after induction chemotherapy. Several new induction chemotherapy treatment developments are currently underway, and future developments are expected. This review article summarizes the current position of induction chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, based on the evidence produced to date, and discusses the future prospects for this treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Okano","given":"Susumu"},{"family":"Homma","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Kiyota","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Tahara","given":"Makoto"},{"family":"Hanai","given":"Nobuhiro"},{"family":"Asakage","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Matsuura","given":"Kazuto"},{"family":"Ogawa","given":"Takenori"},{"family":"Saito","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Sano","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Kodaira","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Motegi","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Koichi"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Shunji"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Kaoru"},{"family":"Onoe","given":"Takuma"},{"family":"Yokota","given":"Tomoya"},{"family":"Imamura","given":"Yoshinori"},{"family":"Ariizumi","given":"Yosuke"},{"family":"Akimoto","given":"Tetsuo"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Ryuichi"}],"citation-key":"okanoInductionChemotherapyLocally2021","container-title":"Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology","DOI":"10.1093/jjco/hyaa220","ISSN":"1465-3621","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,1]]},"page":"173-179","source":"Silverchair","title":"Induction chemotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jjco/hyaa220","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"szturzCisplatinEligibilityIssues2019","abstract":"Well-designed randomized trials provide the highest level of scientific evidence to guide clinical decision making. In chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), data support the use of three cycles of 100 mg/m2 cisplatin given every 3 weeks concurrently with conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy, although a full compliance with all three cycles is reserved to only about two thirds of initially eligible cases. On an individual patient level, practicing oncologists have to determine whether the patient is a suitable candidate for this treatment or whether contraindications exist. In the latter case, an adequate alternative has to be offered. In this regard, to facilitate triaging of medical information, we reviewed available publications on this topic and prepared practice-oriented recommendations for systemic treatment concurrent to definitive and post-operative radiotherapy. Even if no contraindications for the standard-of-care cisplatin apply, clinicians may opt for alternative regimens by adjusting the peak dose, cumulative dose, or timing of cisplatin. Relative contraindications pose the major issue in clinical practice, as very limited data is available in the literature and final decisions are usually based on an expert opinion or retrospective cohort studies. In the case of absolute interdiction of cisplatin, several alternative regimens incorporating carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, cetuximab, and docetaxel are available. At the same time, it should be kept in mind that radiotherapy alone represents a viable option with hyperfractionation being particularly beneficial in the definitive management of limited nodal disease. Ideally, all treatment propositions should be discussed within multidisciplinary tumor boards taking into account the patient- and disease-related characteristics as well as local logistics and reimbursement policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Szturz","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Cristina","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Herrera Gómez","given":"Ruth Gabriela"},{"family":"Bourhis","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."}],"citation-key":"szturzCisplatinEligibilityIssues2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2019.00464","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,11]]},"page":"464","PMCID":"PMC6579895","PMID":"31245288","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Cisplatin Eligibility Issues and Alternative Regimens in Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer: Recommendations for Clinical Practice","title-short":"Cisplatin Eligibility Issues and Alternative Regimens in Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579895/","volume":"9"},

  {"id":"vermorkenWhereWhenUse2021","abstract":"The treatment of locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-HNSCC) is reviewed, highlighting the milestones in systemic therapy in that setting, with focus on the role of induction chemotherapy (ICT). The road to what is now considered the standard ICT regimen, i.e. the TPF (docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU) regimen is described, and the differences between the European and the American TPF are discussed. The article describes the respective roles of ICT for larynx preservation, for treatment intensification, its role in patients with borderline resectable or unresectable oral cavity cancer, its role as a selection tool for radiotherapy dose de-escalation in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) and its potential future role in strategies aiming at synchronous oligometastatic disease.","author":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."}],"citation-key":"vermorkenWhereWhenUse2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_11","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.
