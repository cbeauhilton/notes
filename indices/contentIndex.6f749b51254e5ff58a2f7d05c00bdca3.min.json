For tree-based methods (e.g. random forests, gradient-boosting machines), explainability is fairly solved. For deep learning on images, explainability is also fairly straightorward. Deep learning on tabular data is far less solved (e.g. the Google readmission paper - had to use a handicapped version of their neural network for explainability, and even then was not super useful). Thankfully, tree-based methods are often as good or better in terms of performance on tabular data.\n\nIn my opinion, in all healthcare-facing ML, explainability methods should be baked into the pipeline. It's so easy now, literally a few more lines of code to generate the model that explains the model (incorporating the output in a meaningful way is a little more expensive in terms of code, but if I can figure it out then so can any researcher). The thing we should be building is not a model that is reapplied across systems, but a pipeline for data ingestion, model-building, and explanation that could be rapidly deployed in different systems (e.g. for internal testing and validation). This would still disadvantage poorer systems with less ability to collect data, but maybe not by much - everyone has CBCs, data on discharges and admissions, basic demographic information, etc., and almost everyone uses some kind of EMR.\n\nOn the anthropomorphic relationships with computers, have you heard about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA ? It was developed in the 60s at MIT, simple rules-based conversation \"bot,\" and people developed deep personal connections, on a level equalling or exceeding the current relationships people are building with Alexa (I would argue exceeding, as the conversations were purposefully therapeutic and do not avoid sensitive subjects).\n\nWould be interested in thoughts on why, exactly, Google/Amazon/etc. are needed. We have clinician-scientists, PhD researchers, collaboration with other universities (e.g. CWRU has great comp-sci). We can do NLP, DL, whatever, on our own. Google would have some extra data on searches, all the stuff they can get from cookies, etc., phone data. Amazon would have similarly rich data. But we get into some of the same issues we've seen trying to use Facebook, Twitter, etc. - there's a huge selection bias with who uses those services, and, even if usage nears 100%, the type of usage will vary between pts by orders of magnitude. This could help increase predictive power, but how much? This is a whole different ballgame than simply using AWS or Google Cloud to store or even process data, which is also of questionable utility (we have some rockin' servers over at LRI, and they're buying more).\nSun 17 Nov 2019 10:23:05 AM CST\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T20:06:44.416611565Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/learn/memory":{"title":"","content":"# Memory\n:memory:\n\n## Recall

dozens of simultaneous boards,\nbut seem to have no special short-term memory.\n\nThe seminal set of studies was done by Frey and Adesman, published in 1976.\nShows that advanced players can remember pieces on a board only\nif those pieces could have gotten there in the course of a regular chess game,\ni.e. there are meaningful patterns between the pieces.\nWhen they are shown pieces randomly arranged,\ntheir memory is no better than the novice's.\n\nAnother set of later studies\n(and there are tons of other citations to explore)\nby Gobet and Simon in 1996 confirmed the initial findings,\nand further found that even \"chunking\" as an explanation\nis inadequate to explain the mechanism by which\nthe chess masters could remember so many pieces.\nThey suggest instead templates, which I do not fully understand\nbut seem to be what they sound like,\nlarger frameworks that tell the story of how the current state\ncame to be.\n\nNeil Mehta suggested a wonderful exercise of going through the history\nof antibiotics and their development\n(what problems did each successive generation of drugs solve?)\nas a way to build a framework for antibiotics in general.\nThis would help the student deliberately build the framework that the experienced attending developed piece by piece over time,\nand the idea could be extended to one of my favorite subjects of teacher empathy for student learning:\nthe student is trying to build a framework that is second nature for the attending (resident/fellow) from scratch,\nand it can be hard or impossible to remember how hard or impossible that task felt at the time.\nThat is, the learner can be encouraged to build a framework in a specific way,\nand the teacher can be encouraged to think about all the steps that brought them to their current state of knowledge,\nand maybe even to \"think out loud\" when they perform reasoning\n(which can be hard because perhaps they are, appropriately,\nmostly functioning on unconscious reflex that was build over time).\n\nSun 17 Nov 2019 10:23:05 AM

Based on labs, genes, and demographics, does this patient have disease X or disease Y?\n    - Regression: learn from example the quantitative value of a thing based on other data. E.g. based on local property values, square footage, amenities, for how much will this house sell? Based on lab values that are easy to obtain, can we predict another lab value that is difficult to obtain (e.g. bone marrow cellularity, blast percentage).\n    - Unsupervised: from a set of data, find clusters of similar data points. E.g. from a number of whole genome sequences, find patterns of similarity that can be further explored and correlated with phenotype. In an image, locate areas likely to be of interest.\n\n---\n\n### Why you?\n\nData is king, queen, and jester\n\n- [Breast cancer labels cheating](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/picasso/mats/KDDCup08Expl.pdf), [copy of PDF](http://beauhilton.com/assets/npj-dm-readmit.pdf)\n\nThe goal of this competition, organized by Siemens and available on the Kaggle platform\n(which hosts various data science competitions that individuals or teams can freely compete in, often for a cash prize),\nwas to predict the likelihood of cancer from numeric variables derived from preprocessed images.\nAnonymized patient identification numbers were left in the dataset,\nand the winning competitors noticed that these numbers fell in certain ranges in a nonrandom way:\nif a patient ID fell between 100,000 and 500,000, or above 4,000,000, the likelihood of cancer was very low (1-2%),\nbut if the ID was between 0 and 20,000 the likelihood of cancer was much higher (36%).\n\nThe competitors used this knowledge to build a model that performed very well in predicting which patients had cancer,\nbut would not generalize at all to the real world.\nHowever, because the model was a \"black box\" model,\nthe problematic nature of their model would not be readily apparent,\nand serves as a warning that machine learning practitioners\n(and consumers of such technology)\nshould be wary of the data upon which models were built.\n\nThey wrote a lovely paper detailing their findings and warnings.\nWe can imagine much less scrupulous technologists letting their apparent success ride unchallenged.\n\n- [Luke Oakden-Rayner predicting CT manufacturer from scans](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-019-0105-1), [copy of

scans.\nParticularly with deep learning models used for image analysis,\nin which there may be millions or billions of parameters used to make the final prediction,\nit can be very difficult to know exactly which features the model is pulling out of the image to make its predictions,\nand in what ways those features interact.\nThe authors of this paper chose to turn things around a bit,\nand give the model the task of predicting the manufacturer of the CT machine,\nwhether the order was stat or not, and other relatively non-clinical curiosities.\n\n- [How to Ask an Actionable

weights](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125114/), [copy of PDF](http://beauhilton.com/assets/npj-dm-readmit.pdf)\n\nOne of our projects sought to predict readmission risk and risk of increased length of stay,\nfrom a number of hospital, demographic, laboratory, and other variables.\nI chose to use a model that was amenable to explanation,\nand could also handle missing values by allowing missingness itself to be a signal\n(this is a confusing statement, but will be more clear with the following example).\nIn both predictive tasks, patients with extreme BMIs had higher predicted likelihood of the adverse outcome,\nand, more unexpectedly, so did patients with *missing* BMIs.\n\nI puzzled on this for some time,\nwondering what a missing BMI could be signalling,\nand then took care of a patient transferred from an outside hospital with a C1-C2 infection with high concern for instability.\nHe was never weighed out of concern that standing him up could precipitate a catastrophic event.\nWhile this particular case is undoubtedly rare,\nperhaps it is not so rare to have patients who are sick enough to never be stood up and put on a scale\n(and I do not trust bed weights enough to include them in any predictive model).\n\nI considered throwing this variable out several times because the results seemed, frankly, weird,\nbut time on the wards rescued it,\nand now I find it emblematic of the communication between data science and clinical work.\nAny hospital administrator looking to improve their prediction of which patients are high-risk\nshould consider looking for oddities such as this,\nespecially if the oddity is readily apparent in the hospital database,\nand exploring anything that seems nonrandom, even if the connection is unclear at first.\n\n- [Labelling heme-path images is hard](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29656215/), [copy of PDF](http://beauhilton.com/assets/heme-path-is-hard.pdf)\n\nI tried to build a deep learning model to predict hematologic malignancy phenotype from ultra-high-resolution scans of bone marrow biopsies.\nI failed miserably.\n\nIt turns out this is a very hard problem.\nApart from considerable technical hurdles\n(most deep learning models are trained on images 255x255 or 512x512 pixels, while these images are on the order of 80,000x90,000 pixels, requiring many decisions regarding pre- and post-processing to make the computation tractable),\nwe quickly realized that our data source was not rich enough and would need an enormous amount of work.\nMany important findings are made on a cell-by-cell basis,\nso we would need to label each cell to build a rich ground truth.\nBut labeling cells is no easy task, and requires experienced hematopathologists,\nwho are busy and expensive.\n\nAfter some time I found I was not alone in realizing these difficulties,\nand a group in Japan was way ahead of me and my team in tackling this problem.\nThis paper explicitly states their end goal,\nto build an automated system to perform diagnoses on hematopathological images,\nand then goes on to explain that they realized they needed more data,\nand that collecting that data would require hematopathologists,\nand that hematopathologists are busy and expensive,\nso they would build a system to make the task of labelling easy and fast.\nAs a part of this, they wanted to evaluate the quality of the labels they were going to obtain,\nand so performed a study to quantify agreement between hematopathologists for a select number of cellular entities and quantities.\nThey found consensus in some things, when they were obvious,\nbut nonconsensus in non-obvious things.\n\nHow, then, to build a model to automate part of a hematopathologist's job\n(and hence to make advanced hematopathology available in less resource-rich settings),\nif ground truth is so difficult to obtain, and shaky?\nThis basic problem is repeated throughout machine learning in medicine,\nfrom improperly or incompletely labeled radiographs\nto chart-based diagnoses based on billing concerns more than clinical realities.\nWe need experienced clinicians to generate, evaluate, and mobilize data,\nand there is not (and, I argue, will never be) a substitute for direct experience with real patients\n(or, in the cases of pathology and radiology, the tissues and images of real patients, and consultation with the clinicians who ordered the studies).\n\n---\n\n### How to learn\n\nThere is an ever-growing number of learning resources available for the would-be data scientist.\nThese range from in-person degrees at prestigious institutions,\nto online courses and certifications,\nto books,\nblog posts,\nand code examples that themselves range from the\nline-by-line hands-on approach\nto the highly cerebral and theoretic.\n\nWhich resources you choose to use will depend largely on your goals.\n\nIf you want to be a theoretician,\nyou may start from the ground up\nand study the core mathematics and computer science.\n\nIf you want to be an engineer,\nthat is, one who applies the tools to real world problems,\nyou may prefer a hands-on approach at first,\nand dip into the theory as needed to troubleshoot deeper issues.\n\nYou may want to be neither of these,\nbut instead your goal is to be a responsible citizen\nwithin your medical field,\nwith enough understanding to critique the\nacademic articles and,\nperhaps more importantly,\nsoftware tools employed within your practice and institution.\nThis may be analogous to the way and reasons we learn\nstatistics in medical school,\nnot to become statisticians,\nbut to know how to speak with statisticians,\nhow to collaborate,\nhow to understand what we read,\nand spot poor practice\nor misleading claims.\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T20:06:44.416611565Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/teach/2018_job_roles_of_2025_educator":{"title":"","content":"# Job Roles of the 2025

All of us succeeded in an educational system that was mainly empty of technology. But technology can help. It can motivate, it can make visible what is otherwise not, allow for the study of the complex, taking care of the drudgery and allowing for concentration on the profound. It can be patient. It can give endless rewards and challenges. It continually engages the mind. And it provides a new, more rewarding role for the teacher as a guide, mentor, and fellow explorer of knowledge.\n\n\u003e The proper technology, coupled with proper teachers, can indeed transform. Learning is through doing, or though what I once proclaimed was a state of \"critical confusion.\" People learn best, I argued, when challenged -- just enough to be confused, just enough to be motivated to search, to struggle, and to achieve.\n\n\u003e We learn not by having our heads filled with the great thoughts and ideas of others, but by constructing them within our own conceptual structures. But this construction works best when the scenario is rigged so as to lead us to the ideas, to force us to confront them and understand them. This is what the successful game designer does. This is what the successful educator must do.\n\n\u003e Technology is not the answer, but proper technology coupled with informed pedagogy, coupled with teachers that are coaches, guides and mentors, can lead the way.\n\n---\nSun 17 Nov 2019 10:23:05 AM CST\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T20:06:44.416611565Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/teach/introducing_ml":{"title":"","content":"# Teaching ML\n:teach:\n\n## Introduction\n\nArtificial intelligence is the science of getting machines to do things that intelligent beings do.\n*draw circle with AI*.\nMachine learning is an approach to\n\n\n![dl_ml_venn](/images/dl_ml_venn.jpg)\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5538.pdf\nSun 17 Nov 2019 10:23:05 AM CST\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T20:06:44.416611565Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/teach/introducing_python":{"title":"","content":"# colab\n\nColab is great.\n\n\n# twitter\n\nconsumer_key = 'ENTER_YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'\nconsumer_secret = 'ENTER_YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'\naccess_token = 'ENTER_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'\naccess_token_secret = 'ENTER_YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'\n\n{ezNwnILv8rPXid5shxCXUi8t4} (API key)\n{tQLPLzQ41irSIveROjtxkxibekYEoGtX38xO4oKAkvTBniRJWk} (API secret key)\n\n{788048438-oDRCMjkwYiew69HTSYk5rTKeIbpYedOqipjIaXYG} (Access token)\n{PYLcdWuI7kgMsVqASIdGEDOD4bOhy28oxAZRA3RZpbEFc} (Access token secret)\nRead and write (Access level)\n\nSun 17 Nov 2019 10:23:05 AM CST\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T20:06:44.416611565Z","tags":null},"/notes/archive/tech/SSH_in_git":{"title":"","content":"# ssh_in_git\n:git:ssh:\n\nEntering one's passphrase/password every time a commit is pushed is annoying.

(Btw, the most suckless thing to do would be to just use the user's system monospaced font with `font-family:monospace` -- that's exactly what suckless.org does -- but this is a *personal* blog, dammit, and I'm going to strike a balance between minimalism and personality -- call it essentialism, maybe)\n\nI've been using Derek Sivers' website design as inspiration in a few areas (\u003chttps://sivers.org/style.css\u003e),\nand noticed that his stylesheet has a bunch of gobbledygook at the beginning that looked like a base64-encoded file,\ndumped right in his plaintext CSS.\nThat is exactly what it is,\na font called \"valkyrie_c4,\"\nthat is loaded every time his style.css is loaded.\nInspired by that, but wanting to make my style.css a little more readable,\nI poked around and found `google-webfonts-helper`,\na very cool herokuapp that lets you extract Google Fonts into various formats,\nincluding the woff/woff2 format Derek is using.\n(\u003chttps://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts/ibm-plex-serif\u003e)\nIt also gives you a code snippet to include in your css,\nwhich does the same thing Derek's base64 encoding does but puts the font source code in a different file,\nmaking the css file more readable.\nIt also gives the advantage that after the font is loaded the first time on a user's browser, it can be cached,\nmaking subsequent loads of your already smoking fast static site even faster\n(I currently have a Google PageSpeed of 99/100,\nwith the point docked for a few things including not yet having a font-display css feature,\nand not having a caching policy,\nwhich I used to think was a good idea but might just add complexity I don't really need since my load times are fast without it\n- \u003chttps://ifconfig.se/simple-web-stack.html\u003e).\n\nGoogle PageSpeed gives a few tips,\nand I got mine to 100/100 by just adding `font-display: swap;` to the `@font-face` sections of my style.css.\nThis lets the browser use an existing font while the other font is loaded. \u003chttps://web.dev/font-display/\u003e\n\nAdding caching takes a little more work on OpenBSD with httpd, because httpd doesn't do caching.\nI love that OpenBSD fights feature creep! Instead, use `relayd(8)`.\n\nSome resources on `relayd(8)` and caching:\n\n- \u003chttps://github.com/reyk/httpd/wiki/Using-relayd-to-add-Cache-Control-headers-to-httpd-traffic\u003e\n- \u003chttps://parksdigital.com/httpd-and-relayd-on-openbsd.html\u003e\n- \u003chttps://ifconfig.se/simple-web-stack.html\u003e\n- \u003chttps://web.dev/uses-long-cache-ttl\u003e\n\nSun 28 Jun 2020 06:36:52 AM CDT\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T20:06:44.416611565Z","tags":null},"/notes/deep_work_by_cal_newport":{"title":"Deep Work by Cal Newport","content":"\n# Deep Work by Cal Newport\n\nOne of the chief things which my typical man\nhas to learn is that the mental faculties\nare capable of a continuous hard activity;\nthey do not tire like an arm or a leg.\nAll they want is change---not rest, except in sleep.\n\n* Arnold Bennett, \"How to Live on 24 Hours a Day, 1910\"\n* p. 214\n\nSun 17 Nov 2019 10:23:05 AM CST\n","lastmodified":"2022-12-24T20:06:44.416611565Z","tags":null},"/notes/desert_fathers":{"title":"Desert Fathers","content":"\n\n# On the individuality of worship\n\nA brother asked one of the elders: What good thing shall I do, and have life thereby?
