# graft versus host disease

  
## 2023-01-25 lecture on umbilical cord blood transplant and GVHD

- major contribution of B cell responses -> use of steroids, [[rituximab]], etc.
- [[ruxolitinib]] ( [[JAK]] ), [[ibrutinib]] ( [[BTK]] ) also used
- [[SYK]] signaling is one of the downstream effectors of abnormal B cell activity


### fostamatinib

- [[Rigel Pharmaceuticals]]
- [[SYK]] inhibitor
- oral, dose range 100 daily to 100 BID
- [[FDA indication]] is for multiply relapsed ITP
- seems to work well for [[GVHD]] 
  - main study, phase I, was open-label (Lin & DiCoccio et al, Transplant Cell Ther 2023)
  - used at ppx or tx doses
  - OR 77%
  - median time-to-response 2mo
  - 71% requested to stay on after 1y
  - average steroid dose reduction of 80% (what is the historical control like?)
  - major AE is mild hypertension, some get mild LFT increases (difficult to ddx from hepatic GVHD)
- pts are maintained on chronic [[azoles]] d/t effects on monocytes and other immune subsets
