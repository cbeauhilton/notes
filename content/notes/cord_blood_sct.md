# umbilical cord blood (UCB) sct

## 2023-01-25 lecture on omidubicel (expanded cord blood product)

- standard cord blood SCT
  - main drawback of standard cord blood SCT is time to engraftment, hence infx and TRM
  - total cell doses are lower, so it is less feasible in adult patients
  - double cord blood transplants are used to try and help with the cell dose problem, but are not really faster than single cord blood
  - however, GVHD is much lower (more naive T cells, less immunogenicity)
  - somewhat higher rates of donor-derived myeloid malignancies (BM/PBSCT <1%, UCB 0.5-2%, also tends to set in earlier)
    - likely combination of in utero mutations (that probably wouldn't have caused any issues for the donor) with fertile field for achieving meaningful clonality in the host

- omidubicel
  - uses some [[regenerative medicine]] techniques to expand the cord blood ex vivo
  - faster engraftment than standard cord blood
  - durable, data for cruising on out to 10y (when was this stuff introduced?)
  - one concern with cord expansion techniques is selection for/production of less-fit clones (e.g. MDS)
    - rates in omidubicel are similar to other UCB techniques
  - oddly, chronic GVHD is still a major issue
