- relative brutality rating (tracks somewhat with efficacy, though head-to-head studies are generally lacking):
	- ipi + nivo > lenva + pembro > cabo + nivo > axi + pembro

	- point: low threshold to stop/hold at around this time point if the cancer is responding well and the patient is developing/struggling with drAEs
- debulking nephrectomy in mRCC: bulky, total tumor mass, surgical feasability. More common in the community. Can be a reasonable option depending on the above.
