> It may be, then, that form serves us best
when it works as an obstruction to baffle us
and deflect our intended course.
It may be that when we no longer know what to do
we have come to our real work and that
when we no longer know which way to go
we have begun our real journey.
The mind that is not baffled is not employed.
The impeded stream is the one that sings.

Wendell Berry, "Standing by Woods"

> The most difficult things in the world  
Must be accomplished through the easiest.

Lao Tzu, _Tao Te Ching_ Chapter 63

> The first and fundamental principle of our holy religion is,
that we believe that we have a right to embrace all,
and every item of truth,
without limitation or
without being circumscribed or
prohibited by the creeds or
superstitious notions of men, or by the
dominations of one another,
when that truth is clearly demonstrated to our minds,
and we have the highest degree of evidence of the same.

Joseph Smith, Letter to Isaac Galland, Mar. 22, 1839, Liberty Jail

>When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back, I noticed water. 
In Africa where I was, I didn't have drinkable water. 
Every time I turned on the faucet, I was overwhelmed. 
Every time I clicked on the light, I was so grateful. 
It made me so happy. 
But after a while, this wears off. 
So I put little stickers on the light switch and on the water faucet, 
and every time I turned it on, water. 
So leave it up to your own imagination. 
You can find whatever works best for you, but you need stop signs in your life. 
And when you stop, then the next thing is to look. 
You look. You open your eyes. You open your ears. You open your nose. 
You open all your senses for this wonderful richness that is given to us. 
There is no end to it, and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.

David Steindl-Rast

>I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.

Douglas Adams

>I don't want to get to the end of my life and find that I just lived the length of it.
