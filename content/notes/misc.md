> It may be, then, that form serves us best
when it works as an obstruction to baffle us
and deflect our intended course.
It may be that when we no longer know what to do
we have come to our real work and that
when we no longer know which way to go
we have begun our real journey.
The mind that is not baffled is not employed.
The impeded stream is the one that sings.

Wendell Berry, "Standing by Woods"

> It's dark because you are trying too hard.

> The most difficult things in the world  
Must be accomplished through the easiest.

Lao Tzu, _Tao Te Ching_ Chapter 63

> The first and fundamental principle of our holy religion is,
that we believe that we have a right to embrace all,
and every item of truth,

prohibited by the creeds or
superstitious notions of men, or by the
dominations of one another,
when that truth is clearly demonstrated to our minds,
and we have the highest degree of evidence of the same.

Joseph Smith, Letter to Isaac Galland, Mar. 22, 1839, Liberty Jail
