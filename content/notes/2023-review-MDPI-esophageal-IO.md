"An Ailment with Which I Will Contend": 5,000 years of esophagogastric cancers and their treatments, with special emphasis on recent advances in immunotherapies

The Southampton library in the UK sent me a scan of John Casaubon's diary entry describing his EC. The current available texts are fine, but have some inappropriate ellipses (which make it look like parts of the text are being omitted), and stop before the final lines, for no apparent reason. Below is my attempt at transcription.

Monday Dec 29. 90.
 At dinner I was almost choaked by swallowing a bit of a roasted Sd of mutton which as I thought stuck in the passage about the mouth of the stomach. But it suffered noething to goe downe and the stomach threw all up, though never soe small in quantitie, to all our amazements the sckilfull not knowing what 2 make of my condition. It being an unusuall afflixion wch. my melancholi suggested it an extraordinarie judgment. I could swallow about 2 spoonfulls about half way (as I thought) and then it would flush up in spite of my hart. Some small humiditie or dropps of what I dranck, rather distilld, or dropt into the stomach which afforded a bare living nourishment and on a sudden I grew lean as a skeleton and at some tymes very faint and feeble, although I recouerd in some measure and had stomach 2 eate, my meate doeth noe gt. good and I am in a kind of atrophie. What warme weather may do I cant' tell, but hope well. Alwayes after I have bine at Stoole I am for a whyle very faint or weake which I much wonder at. It is a sine of gt weakenes certainly and of insoaed decay.

Translation to modern spelling:

 At dinner I was almost choked by swallowing a bit of a roasted side of mutton which as I thought stuck in the passage about the mouth of the stomach. But it suffered nothing to go down and the stomach threw all up, though never so small in quantity. To all our amazements the skillful not knowing what to make of my condition, it being an unusual affliction, which my melancholy suggested it an extraordinary judgment. I could swallow about two spoonfuls about half way (as I thought) and then it would flush up in spite of my heart. Some small humidity or drops of what I drank, rather distilled, or dropped into the stomach, which afforded a bare living nourishment and on a sudden I grew lean as a skeleton and at some times very faint and feeble, although I recovered in some measure and had stomach to eat, my meat doeth no great good and I am in a kind of atrophie. What warm weather may do I can't tell, but hope well. Always after I have been at stool I am for a while very faint or weak which I much wonder at. It is a sign of great weakness certainly and of inside decay.
