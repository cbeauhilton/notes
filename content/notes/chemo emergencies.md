# chemo emergencies/urgencies/toxicity overview

# platinum agents


# [[taxane]] hypersensitivity
- double check chemo plans, also triple remind the pts (home-based regimens, they will need to remember to take the steroids, etc.)
# cetuximab
- anaphylaxis most common in areas w Lone star tick bites, allergy to red meat
# [[rituximab]]
- infusion reaction, different than hypersensitivity rxn (not IgE mediated)
- prevention: premed APAP + antihistamine
- slow titration of infusion rate
- if rxn occurs (usu anaphylactoid, usu w/in 30-120min):
	- stop or slow rate (50%), depending on severity
	- if stopped, wait a bit, give steroids (dealer's choice, but IV hydrocortisone is pretty standard), and whatever else you think is indicated (e.g. meperidine), and restart at 50% of prior rate, increase every 30min or so
# [[daratumumab]]
- hypersensitivity
- 1st infusion, occurs in up to 50% of pts on IV therapy (~13% of SQ)

# [[obinutuzumab]]
- reaction *and* hypersensitivity

# [[gemtuzumab ozogamicin]]
- hypersensitivity
- same deal: stop infusion, give steroids, resume at 50% when sx resolved

# [[5-FU]] or [[capecitabine]]
- homozygotes for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) mutation, or thymidylate synthase mutation. 
- severe GI, hematologic, cardiac, neurologic toxicities
- antidote: uridine triacetate, direct antagonist (removes benefit of 5-FU, also reduces)
- 615-343-9211 chemo pharmacist on-call

# HD-[[MTX]]
- protocolized, antidote is glucarpidase (Voraxaze)

# [[ifosfamide]] encephalopathy
- confusion (80%), hallucination (30%), incontinence/muscle twitching. Can look comatose.
- biggest risk: elevated creatinine
- tx: methylene blue (MAO pathway -> chloracetaldehyde, ifos metabolite thought to be the offending agent. unknown if methylene blue actually helps)
# [[gemcitabine]]
- "gem flu": w/in 24-48h after infusion: 45% fever (usually low, but can be very high), 20% flu-like sx
- gemcitabine-related TMA: mimics TTP. can occur at any time, v rare. tx w holding drug, consider eculizumab.

# [[everolimus]]
- SWISH study gave dexamethasone swish and spit, helped reduce incidence of stomatitis

# when ok to hold drugs
- most oral agents are ok to hold, particularly if the goal of tx is palliative

# irritant vs vesicant
- irritant: PIV
- vesicant: central line (port, PICC), but not absolute rule

# when to get a port?
- infusional chemo
- vesicant chemo w high rate of rxn: e.g. anthracycline, higher dose cisplatin, most breast cancer regimens, aggressive leukemia/lymphoma regimens
- e.g. TCHP
- if had PICC for their first cycle, try to get a port for the next cycle (or if you have time before the first cycle and they'll need a PICC eventually, can get a port instead)

# pump malfunctions
## neulasta on-body injector (OBI)
- most important question: is the med reservoir empty?
- if pump is messed up, get them an Extended Hours Clinic appt
- if messed up w/in 72h of chemo and neulasta not given, ok to place one-time order for SQ pegfilgrastim and schedule infusion appt
