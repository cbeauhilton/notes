The [Husky work bench](https://nymag.com/strategist/article/husky-adjustable-work-table.html)I'm using as a standing desk is awesome. 

Sturdy, easy to adjust, looks good, 
made of real wood 
so I can attach all kinds of stuff to the underside using normal screws, 
cheap comparatively,
will have a great second life as an actual garage workbench if I ever decide to switch to an electric standing desk,
etc., etc.

However, I'm a little tall, something like 6'3". 
As such, the maximum height of the desk is a little short for ideal ergonomics 
(90 degree angle at the elbows). 
(For sitting, it's perfect, between chair adjustment and the built-in desk adjustment I can tune it in perfectly). 

I thought about adding some height to the legs with the little blocks, 
but I dig the ability to roll it around - 
this has been way more useful than I assumed it would be before the purchase. 

So, instead of raising the whole desk, 
I'm going to build a little platform to raise the desk pad.

Dimensions of planned platform: 2.5" x 32" x 16"

I'll probably also build something that lets me clamp the monitor up higher, 
since when I'm standing it's roughly 3-4" too short at the maximum extension of the monitor arm. 
This platform should be ~5" higher than the desk surface, 
since the monitor arm can adjust down it will be better to overshoot a bit.
