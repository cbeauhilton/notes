When we tallied and compared our death rates 
across our clinics in the first two years of fellowship, 
it was something like 25%. 
Might be interesting to write a story where that rate is 100%, 
by pure bad luck 
(i.e. mgmt was done right, 
but by the end of the clinic experience 
every patient the fellow followed had died). 
Explore questions about what our job is really about, 
what it means to help someone with cancer, 
what it means for the patient's relationship with the physician 
when the treatment doesn't work,
what it means for the physician on the other side.
