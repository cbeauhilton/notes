# The [[Design of Everyday Things]] by [[Don Norman]]

A conceptual model is an explanation,
usually highly simplified, of how something works.
It doesn't have to be complete or even accurate as long as it is useful.
Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that support them hold true.

People don't want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!

* pp. 33-34
