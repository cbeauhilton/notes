- Incidentally found gall bladder adeno (from cholecystectomy, usually)
	- T1a (lamina propria) w -margins: obs vs cape
			- when would you use cape? Survival rates of chole w -ve margins approach 100% [[boards-2025-onc-questions]]
	- T1a w +margins, or >=T1b, go back for hepatic resection, lymphadenectomy, poss bile duct excision.
	- T2: up to 40% chance of LN+, definitely don't skip the surgery
	- If R0 and -ve LN, obs vs 5FU CRT vs 5FU/cape alone
- R1 resection
	- ~40% of resections are R1
	- chemo + CRT vs CRT + chemo vs chemo alone. CRT should be 5-FU based.
	- chemo alone (usu capecitabine) is preferred by NCCN. No head-to-head prospective studies are available to compare CRT w chemo alone. Retrospective studies exist, at least one trends toward benefit w CRT in R1, N0 pts (https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fcurroncol30050358). I think it's reasonable to offer CRT to fit patients with R1 N0 disease, recognizing the paucity of data for this approach. If I had to guess, I would say that larger RCTs will show benefit for CRT, since that's the pattern in most other diseases and the available BTC data trends towards benefit.
	- R1 N+, would probably be best to talk to rad onc and see what they think about the radiation field, but might still offer CRT

### studies
- #BILCAP
	- adjuvant [[drugs-capecitabine]]
	- RFS is marginally better, only statistically sig in the per-protocol analysis (HR 0.77)
- ASCOT
	- adjuvant [[drugs-S1]]
	- non-US-only
	- positive study, I didn't look up the details

### studies
- #ABC-02
	-  #published-in-2010
	- https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa0908721
	- phase III RCT, gem+cis vs gem
	- N=410
	- mOS 11.7mo vs 8.1mo
	- mPFS 8.0mo vs 5.0mo
	- established gem+cis as SoC, then TOPAZ-1 added durva
	
- #TOPAZ-1
	- #published-in-2022
	- https://doi.org/10.1056/evidoa2200015
	- [[phase III]] [[RCT]], [[drugs-durvalumab]] + chemo (gem+cis)
	- durva q21, gem+cis d1+d8, up to 8 cycles of chemo then durva ongoing
	- used PD-L1 [[TAP score]] - no difference b/w PD-L1 expressors and non-expressors
		- MSI status was missing in 50% of pts, but prob doesn't matter
		- hx MSI % is 1.5% in met biliary
	- N=685
	- 24mo survival: 24.9% vs 10.4%. 
	- ORR 26.7% vs 18.7%
	- No sig difference in g3/4 TEAE
	- established new SoC
