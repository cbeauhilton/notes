## epidemiology of EGFR mutations

- US - approx 15%, more frequent in women and nonsmokers
- Asia (China, Hong Kong, India, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam) - 22-62%. 
	- 37% in smokers
	- these numbers are from the #PIONEER study
- early studies linked demographic factors with response to TKI, but later it was shown that these were surrogates for the presence of specific mutations (exon 19 del, L858R point mutation in exon 21)


## testing wrt tx
- tx if tx needed, chemo still works and can help get out of a bad situation
- no evidence for when to switch from classical chemo to TKI
	- many will do four cycles before switching, as long as the chemo is going well enough
 - needs to be mutated to predict TKI efficacy, not just high copy number

## #osimertinib is the bomb
- 3rd gen #TKI
- EGFR exon 19 del, exon 21 L858R mut - #1L for both
- effective with T790M mutation (resistance to other TKIs)
- #FLAURA #phase-III trial
	- osi vs #gefitinib or #erlotinib 
	- PFS 18.9 vs 10.2mo
	- OS 38.6 vs 31.8
	- RR 80% vs 76%
	- DoR 17.2 vs 8.5
	- >=G3 tox 34% vs 45%
