## overall

Art Wheeler (paraphrased) - the best mode of ventilation is the mode you know best.


## knobs

Many!
- FiO2
- rate(t)
- Pi
- PEEP
- I:E ratio
- TV (Vt)
- etc.

but really:
- FiO2
- triggers
- Q (flow)
- C (cycle)

and cannot perfectly control pressure and volume at the same time,
though modes like PRVC attempt to strike an automated balance.

oxygenation: FiO2 (directly) and PEEP (via mean airway pressure)

ventilation: R(t), Vt, Pi


## APRV 
  
Type of inverse ratio ventilation, 
based on time constants of collapse/expiration.

e.g. expire ~75% of TV in a time constant.


## SIMV

supported intermittent mechanical ventilation. 

Background of VC at a certain rate,
allowed to take supported breaths in between.

~CMV w BiPAP


## AC

assist control.

volume control, people are allowed to take breaths and then volume is delivered

set: Vt, PEEP, R(t), FiO2

measure: peak inspiratory pressures, plateau pressures, MV, driving pressure (plateau minus PEEP)

triggers: P or Q (e.g. neuromuscular, may not be able to generate much flow so set pressure trigger, COPD often the opposite)

cycle: time


## PC

set: P(high), P(low), Pi, R(t)

measure: Vt, V

triggers: P or Q

cycle: time

set a MV alarm (ideally, set at what has been maintaining ventilation for that pt)


## PRVC

set target volume, generates pressures, adjusts based on calculation of last three breaths

is actually pressure control mode
