# Coding and Billing

Beth Ann Yakes, who is awesome.

ICD-10 Codes
- International Classification of Diseases

CPT
- Descriptive terms and their codes to identify medical, surgical, and diagnostic services and procedures

E&M service codes
- CPT codes
- Evaluation and Management Codes

Preventive service codes
- CPT codes for annual physical, non-medicare

## E&M codes

- history
- exam
- Medical Decision Making (MDM) (or Time in 2021)


Hx
- CC and HPI
- ROS
- PFSH

Exam
- # organ systems (out of 12 possible)

MDM
- # and complexity of problems addressed
- amount of data/complexity analyzed
- risk level to pt

If established patient,
does not need to have *both* hx or exam,
can have one or the other.

Money amounts listed are for the professional fees,
not necessarily including hospital fees, etc.

Average clinic day:
12 pts, ~2 $75, ~8 $110, ~2 $150 = ~$150 + $880 + $300 = ~$1330/day produced per provider

99213 ("level 3") ~$75.

- 1 HPI (pt is here for sore throat)
- 1 ROS (pt denies fever or chills)
- no PFSH
- 2 PE (general: pt looks well, HEENT: no exudates, mild erythema)
- 2/3 of the following
    - address 2 minor/1 stable/1 acute uncomplicated problem
    - review 2 pieces of data or use an independent historian (e.g. collateral from spouse)
    - low risk tx and dx tests (e.g. OTC, simple PE maneuvers)

99214 ("level 4") ~$110 (annual physical also about this amount).

- this is the level to keep in mind for notes, even if the MDM is level 3, just to cover your bases
- 4 HPI (1. pt has not had CP or SOB, 2. pt has had normotension, 3. pt has been compliant with their medicines, 4. something else)
- 2 ROS
- 1 PFSH (at least copy and paste from old note, or click "mark as reviewed" - does NOT need to be an actual update)
- 5 PE
- 2/3 of the following
    - address 2 stable/1 worsening/1 new w systemic sx/complicated hx/uncertain prognosis)
    - review 3 pieces of data (inc ind historian), or interpret (I reviewed the CXR and do not see pna) (it's also ok to be wrong, just give good-faith effort) (lab data doesn't count, has to be radiographic or similar), or confer (does not have to be verbal conference - could be chart review of specialist's note)
    - moderate risk tx and dx tests (rx meds - could be "cont lisinopril", social determinants limit options, elective surgery w/o major risks)

99215 ("level 5") - ~$150.

- 4 HPI
- 10 ROS
- 2 PFSH
- 8 PE
- 2/3 of the following
    - 1 severe worsening or threat-imposing new problem
    - 2/3 of what is listed in moderate
    - higher risk tx or dx (rx req monitoring e.g. coumadin/opioids/chemo, hospitalization, emergent surgery)


## Preventive service codes

Annual physical - ~$110.

- No CC/HPI
- 14 ROS
- PMH, FH, SH (c/p or "mark as reviewed" is sufficient)
- address risk factors appropriate to age
- multi-system PE targeted to pt
- a/p including counseling, anticipatory guidance, risk factor mitigation
- Identify note as "Preventive annual exam"
- ICD-10: Z00.00
- can add other ICD-10 codes as needed
- billing code based on pt age
    - 99395: 18-40
    - 99396: 41-64
    - 99397: >65, not medicare
- no co-pay! (if w/in calendar year vs 365 days, depending on insurance provider)
- tell the pt if you're not going to code the visit as annual physical, bc they'll be charged
- can also bill for annual + problem (e.g. 99396 Z00.00 + 99213 R07.89 [CP])

Coding based on counseling time

- Lvl 3: 15min
- Lvl 4: 25min
- Lvl 5: 40min
- state "I spent X minutes with the pt with >50% spent on counseling regarding Y issue. We went over A, B, C, answered questions about Q, did teachback..."
- pick the highest billing lvl bw coding based on time or based on problem severity (e.g. lvl 3 prob, lvl 5 counseling)
- in Jan 2021, may be able to count time spent preparing for visit and reviewing afterward, as well as in-person time
