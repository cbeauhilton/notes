### Agranulocytosis

ANC <200.

Inherited: BEN, familial neutropenia, congenital neutropenia

Infx: HIV, EBV, CMV, HHV6, measles, rubella, varicella, brucella, tularemia, TB, shigella, anaplasmosis, 

Drugs: 
- weeks-months after initiation of drug, typically ~4wks, 2-15 cases/y/10^6 people, mean age 51, M==F
- anti-thyroid (PTU, _MMI_), psych: _clozapine_ (MCC), antibacterial (_bactrim_, macrolides, cephalo, dapsone, penicillin), NSAIDs, colchicine, _sulfasalazine_

MoA drug-induced: not clear, two hypotheses (good review in Blood)
- hapten (covalent binding to cell surface protein by reactive metabolites)
- danger signal (+inflammasome by drug-protein conjugates w/in PMN, +oxidized)
- some GWAS studies underway, may have association w HLA

Duration - mean 8d, but can be much longer

Presentation - ~50% present w infx

BMBx - usually hypoplastic, but could be hyperplastic or have other goofiness

Outcomes - possibly improved over the years. No significant difference wwo GCSF, however most folks do get GCSF.

Some learning points:
- acute toxo can look exactly like mono, down to splenomegaly
- no one should die w/o a dose of doxy
- don't mix azathioprine w allopurinol
