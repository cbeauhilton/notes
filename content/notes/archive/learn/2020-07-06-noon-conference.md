# Acute respiratory failure (most of this in Vandy handbook)

## Modes of oxygen

- NC - up to ~6L, ~40% FiO2
- HFNC - up to ~15L, 80% FiO2
- Venti mask - not used often, controlled with attachable and switchable filters
- Non-rebreather - up to ~100% FiO2, turn flow up all the way, fill up reservoir first then apply
- bipap - usu ICU, careful with aspiration risk, can adjust insp/exp pressures, up to 100% FiO2
- optiflow - up to 60L, 100% FiO2, usu ICU

## Get help

- Esp if res-interning, don't hesitate to call/ask nurse to call Rapid Response Team (1-1111)

## Differential

(pt with known COPD desatting)

- Most likely: COPD; other most common: CHF; must not miss: PE

## Order

- CXR, EKG, trop, BNP
- bipap (not available on regular nursing floors), duonebs, lasix


## COPD exacerbation

- fairly algorithmic:
    - bipap
    - O2 for sat 90-94%, or >88% if on O2 at home
    - Prednisone 40mg x 5d
    - Albuterol/ipatropium q4-q6
    - abx


## LASIX

- feel free to give big push (e.g. 160) of lasix if any concern for volume overload
- even if AKI - oxygenation takes priority, can rehydrate kidneys later

## Anaphylaxis

- call RRT (have friends - pt can need intubation, etc.)
- 0.3mg of 1mg/ml IM epinephrine (on crash carts) (if not responding, put on drip)
- O2
- stop offending meds/infusions


## PE

- ddx: PE, pneumonia, STEMI, PTX (hence EKG, CTA or CXR if can't get CTA quickly, trop, BNP)
- if AKI: can get VQ scan instead of CTA, but if suspicion is high start treating
- massive (+hypotension): catheter-directed thrombolysis
- submassive (normotensive, RV dysfxn + inc trop or BNP): heparin gtt or lovenox (preferred if possible - therapeutic more quickly with less futzing)

## Afib w RVR

- HR >120 and stable: IV metop 5mg (up to 3x @ 5min intervals) or dilt (avoid if reduced EF, and often don't know, so usu metop)
- HR <120 and stable: oral metop tartrate 25mg
- unstable: cardioversion
- also something about amio drip that I missed, usu done in MICU/CCU
