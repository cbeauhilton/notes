# troubleshooting vents

Scott McCall

## high peak pressures

Start at the machine.

Make sure the system is working well - 
check tubes for kinks, 
follow it all the way from the vent to the patient,
look for biting, etc.

Within the patient,
think about mucus plugs at the end of the ETT,
single-lung intubation,
mainstem intubation,
PTX,
hemothorax,
ARDS.

Get: CXR, plateau pressure

## low minute ventilation

vent problem vs patient problem

vent problem (are we actually having high peak pressures?)

patient problem
- is the cuff inflated?
- has the patient been intubated for a long time (balloon migration, tube breakdown)?
- bronchopleural fistula
