# codes

Alex Dragnich


## good codes

- calm
- closed communication
- established roles
- room logistics (number of humans needed == number of humans present, stools, move stuff)
- no ego


## roles

Essential roles:

- compressions
- airway
- timekeeper
- code leader
- meds
- pulse (+/- doppler)
- pharmacy

Sometimes:

- procedures
- ultrasound
- logistics


## first 30 seconds

- compressions (assess for quality with whatever tools you have: ETCO2, a-line, tele, visual)
- lock the bedboard
- pads on 
- access (IO!)
- airway


## H's and T's

- hypothermia
- hypoxia
- hyper/hypoK
- H+
- hypovolemia
- hypoglycemia (bonus)

- tension
- tamponade
- thrombus (coronary)
- thrombus (pulmonary)
- toxins


## room management

- loud room: "Volume down in the code room."
- crowded room: "Those without an active role, exit the room."
- things aren't getting done: closed loop communication, "1mg of epi, please confirm when done."
- someone is struggling with a task: redeploy them (e.g. compressions, contact family, etc.)


## after the code

Debrief.
