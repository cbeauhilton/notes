# pressors


MAP = SVR * CO

CO = HR * SV

# receptors

alpha1, beta1, beta2

alpha1 = vessel walls, contracts

beta1 = contractility

beta2 = vasodilation, bronchodilation

vasopressin/ADH = V1 (vasoconstriction in the periphery), V2 (in kidneys)

AngII = inc aldosterone, peripheral vasoconstriction.  

# drugs

epi = +++alpha1, +++beta1, ++beta2. 
Useful during codes, anaphylaxis (bronchodilation), third(ish)-line in sepsis.

norepi = ++alpha1, ++beta1, no beta2. 
Go-to pressor. 

phenylephrine = +++alpha1, no beta1, no beta2. 
Useful pressor if tachyarrhythmia and not in cardiogenic shock.

dobutamine = no alpha1, ++beta1, +beta2. 
Used in cardiogenic shock (+chronotropy, +inotropy), pHTN.

dopamine = not really used any more

vasopressin (ADH) = mostly looking for V1 effects

AngII = Used in septic shock. 
Very pt-dependent, 
"super-responders" (~10%) can sometimes come off all other pressors, 
most folks don't respond much. 
C/i in heart failure. 
Increases clotting (cannot use if cannot use DVT ppx).

also think about: 
stress-dose steroids (little downside, cortisol testing is useless in critically ill pts), 
acidosis (do they need bicarb drip/post-replacement bicarb?)


# access

Pressors via PIVs are usually fine. 
No actual dosage cutoff, 
some institutions will create cutoffs 
but there's no data for that.

Extravasation rate ~3/1000 in one retrospective study of ~14,000 pts.
