### Pearls

- GCA ~20% have ESR wnl.
- GCA is MCC otherwise unexplained fever >3wk in adults >60yo (~30%)
- ESR is primarily measure of fibrinogen concentration, unlikely to drop fast w a few days of relatively low-dose steroids
- some series describe an increased incidence of malignancy w/in 6-12mo of GCA dx, however it appears this may be mostly d/t increased follow-up and extensive workup
