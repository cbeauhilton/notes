# Acid-base

JP Arroyo

H+ + HCO3- <---> H2O + CO2 ---> Vm

Minute ventilation is a key but often overlooked part of the equation, 
need escape route for CO2.

sugar + O2 ---> ATP + CO2 + H2O <---> H+ + HCO3- ---> CO2 ---> lungs ---> the world

CO2 is a volatile acid, bc its H+ was donated.

Nonvolatile acids: H2SO4 (e.g. muscle breakdown), HCl

Kidney's roles in acid-base:

Circulating: HCO3- 24meQ/L
Acid production: 1 mEq H+/kg/day

Offset acid production by:

1. reabsorb HCO3-
2. make new HCO3-
3. excrete H+

## acid base interpretation

ABG HCO3- is trustworthy, need a concomitant BMP to assess true anion gap

1. internal consistency (ABG and BMP should be drawn close temporally, results w/in about 2mEq)
2. ?pH - <7.35 or >7.45
3. assess for primary disorder, (is the compensation appropriate)?
  - most concerning/difficult/common in sick patients is metabolic acidosis
  - metabolic acidosis: low HCO3-
  - metabolic acidosis ---> increased Vm
  - 1.5(HCO3-) + 8 +/- 2 = predicted CO2
4. AG (Na+ - (Cl- + HCO3-)) should be ~10
5. dAG + HCO3- (delta anion gap plus bicarb)


Practical: loaded ABG are ok, just don't directly compare the loaded ABG w the same time BMP (use one or the other as able)
