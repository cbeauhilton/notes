# Dx

Ehrlichiosis! Tx w doxy.

Time to diagnosis is delayed in pts who require ICU admission (Kuriakose 2020, JAMA Network Open, e202577)

# Pearls

For RMSF, no need to send w/u unless clear geographic exposure.

Send Ehrlichia/anaplasmosis PCR, smear, consider babesia.

Lyme: should have travelled north of the Mason-Dixon line, not endemic to TN.
