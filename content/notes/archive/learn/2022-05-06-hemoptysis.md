## when to intubate

if they've already coded, or are very close to it

if a person is awake enough to cough, 
they are better at clearing the small airways than we are with suction


## ABCs

A - late intubation
A - mainstem/positioning (intubate the clear side, put the sick side down)

B - 

C - ~3L of blood can fit in a typical lung, may need massive transfusion protocol


## meds

TXA - if the inhaled drug can get to the problematic areas, e.g. bronchitis/bronchiectasis
  - literature suggests TXA is helpful if the coagulation cascade is relatively normal (e.g. no mortality benefit in cirrhosis)

PCC vs FFP - 
no in vivo or in vitro evidence that 
drug levels or coagulation parameters are meaningfully improved with PCC, 
Xa decoy (Andexanet Alfa) does work but is expensive and not often stocked

## imaging

CT bronchial artery protocol (CT angio w relatively early shots)

GGO, can be tree-in-bud (clot)

## causes

- bronchitis/bronchiectasis (in bronchiectasis the vessels are closer to the surface)
- PNA
- PE (usu late, distal, scant, r/t necrosis)
- malignancy - things that recruit VEG-F - thymic, thyroid (papillary), melanoma, Kaposi
- cavitary lung lesions (TB, fungal balls, Erasmus formation)
