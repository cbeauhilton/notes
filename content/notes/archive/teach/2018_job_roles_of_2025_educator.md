# Job Roles of the 2025 Medical Educator
:teach:

- Futurist concept of *hard trends* (the cite, sadly, is not Kevin Kelly)
	- measurable predictions
- Outsourcing
- WTH do they mean by "big data"? In what world will there be enough data streams of sufficient size coming from med students to justify this terminology?

## Roles

- Diagnostic Assessor
	- Even if the use if the term "big data" is misguided, the idea is well-taken - data will be generated, some of it useful for predictive modeling. Can we collect data that can lead to meaningful early interventions, etc.?

- Content Curator
	- situatedness (the smoke filled back room, the history of the thing)
	- levels of curation
	-


- Technology Adopter
	- maybe KK's "Amish Hackers" article would be good addition here
	- I don't know if "must be early adopters" is right at all
	-

- Learner-Centered Navigator and Professional Coach
	- another aspect of this may be that as medical knowledge expands, medical education shrinks to cover the essentials (whatever those are deemed to be) and allow self-directed exploration of deeper topics in whichever field. The coach would help the student discover and direct deeper interests, and connect them with resources (human and technological)
	-

- Clinician Role Model
	- yup, on board with this one
	- tho I don't think each clinician has to model everything perfectly, nor could they

- Learning Environment Designer, Engineer, Architect, and Implementer
	- kind of ties much of the above together - know what the students need (has assessed the state), what content is already available, which technologies may  or may not be useful to fill the gap. May or may not have coach and/or role model roles as well.
