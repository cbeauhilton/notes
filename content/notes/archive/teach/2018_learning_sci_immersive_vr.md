# VR vs not-VR for learning
:teach:

## multimedia learning
- learn from words and pictures

## coherence principle
- people learn better when extraneous words are excluded
- not just words, but details (e.g. cartoons can work better than photographs in certain settings)
- what is extraneous depends on context and learning goal

## segmenting principle
- people learn better in user-directed segments

## generative learning theory
- selecting, organizing, integrating

## add a feature
- have people step in and out of the game to process (e.g. give them a worksheet to fill out as they play the game)
