# Kevin Mitchell on unconscious bias

- started with intersectionality (he trained as a pharmacist, then physician, is a veteran, from Miami, a husband, a father, a black man, --also big Harry Potter fan)

- "Code Switching"
    - switching language and behavior based on context
    - learned from mother to purposefully code switch
    - "don't be a stereotype..." (or statistic - non-grad, etc.)
    - data - [Race, Ethnicity, and NIH Research Awards](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/1015) "2011 Science Mag, Ginther et al. : if top-tier scores, funded equally well, but below upmost echelons people who were black or of Asian decent less likely to be funded
    - [Racial Disparities in Pain Management of Children With Appendicitis in Emergency Departments](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2441797) (JAMA, Goyal et al.) : children of color less likely to receive analgesia for severe pain
    - Assimilative techniques: passing (concealing: appear as member of dominant group), temporary passing (projecting), covering (downplay salience)

- Consequences of code switching
    - imposter syndrome, burden of duality, burnout
    - gift and curse: street credibility vs professionalism; empathy vs sympathy; pt trust vs colleague comfort

- how to respond to racist/sexist comments (this is a tl;dr of bystander training)
    - take note
    - stabilize patient
    - address the issue
    - stabilize victim

- other notes:
    - his "solutions" slide was blank when he first started giving this talk, now has several ideas and many angles -- the process of gaining hope and strategy can definitely start with no concrete solutions, but if it's important, keep working at it, get some friends, ideas will come
    - look into race-based GFR, its history and problems
