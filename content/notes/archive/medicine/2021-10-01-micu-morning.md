# Pre-intubation

Presented with O2 sat 81% to the ED, what's next?

## NC

Max flow through standard NC ~6L/min.

~3-4% increase in FiO2 per L, so 2L/min ~= 30% FiO2.

Minute ventilation ~5L/min if assume 10 breaths per minute, 
~500mL tidal volume, 
but: 
- those are averaged over one minute 
- moment inspiration will exceed that flow rate, 
- the seal isn't perfect,

we're typically putting O2 on dyspneic people,
so those assumptions typically do not hold.

## Large-bore NC

Bigger tube, up to ~15L/min. Otherwise same as NC.

## Venturi mask

Size of holes determines rough amount of entrainment.

## NRB

One-way exhale valves, bag w 100% O2.
Still getting some entrainment, but overall higher O2 delivered.

## HFNC

Optiflow, Airvo, etc.

Up to 60L, 100% FiO2.
Humidified air, 
more complete seal on nose piece.
Less complications from dry air (massive epistaxis),
less entrainment (though depends on if their mouth is closed).
Also provides up to ~5L PEEP.

Blends 100% O2 and medical air to achieve the set FiO2.

[FLORALI trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1503326)
  - intubation rate between HFNC and NIPPV was not different (primary outcome)
  - ventilator free-days were different (higher in HFNC)
  - 90d mortality rate better for HFNC than NIPPV

# NIPPV

Pressure increase (mean airway pressure),
more O2 exchange d/t greater partial pressures of delivered O2
over more time.

# Invasive ventilation

Next week...
