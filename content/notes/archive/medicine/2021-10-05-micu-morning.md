# ARDS

Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

## How to confirm "Noncardiogenic"?

Gold standard would be RHC, 
but typically defined clinically

## [Berlin Criteria](https://www.mdcalc.com/berlin-criteria-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#evidence)

P/F ratio. 

Severity ratings (for prognostication, do not influence tx)

- <300 mild
- 100-200 moderate
- <100 severe

PEEP >= 5.

Acute: onset w/in 1wk of insult

## Etiologies

Two major branches:
Pulmonary vs extrapulmonary.

Extrapulmonary: anything inflammatory (pancreatitis, sepsis)


## Mgmt

### Low-tidal volume ventilation: 6mL/kg of ideal body weight

[NEJM 2000](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm200005043421801)

Finer points from this article:

- 6 vs 12
- plateau pressure targets differed
- allowances for adjusting tidal volume based on ventilation needs
- used pressure control, which has led to wider use of this mode

### Conservative fluid mgmt

[NEJM 2006](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa062200)

- no mortality difference
- improvements in ventilator-days and ICU days
- CVP endpoint less than 4, almost never reached == never cease to diurese

### Proning

[NEJM 2013](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1214103)

- large reported mortality benefit
- results called into question

### Paralysis

[NEJM 2019](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1901686)

- no mortality benefit
- still will paralyse patients, but not early as part of routine practice

### Steroids (all-comers)

[Lancet 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32043986/)

- done just prior to COVID-19
- long enrollment period, very strict enrollment criteria
- possible improvement in ventilator-days and mortality

### VV Ecmo

[NEJM 2018](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1800385)

![EOLIA KM Curve](https://www.nejm.org/na101/home/literatum/publisher/mms/journals/content/nejm/2018/nejm_2018.378.issue-21/nejmoa1800385/20190311/images/img_medium/nejmoa1800385_f2.jpeg)

- trial ended early for futility, but KM curves did diverge
