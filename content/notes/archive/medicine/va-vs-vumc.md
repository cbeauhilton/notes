# VA vs VUMC 
(or other academic medical centers)

At VUMC, the VA is right across a walkway (or vice versa).
Despite physical proximity, 
the two institutions have vastly different backend structures.

VA -> US Dept of Veterans Affairs

VUMC -> TN Dept Health (but mostly self monitors)

## residents vs hospitalist teams
VA: Residents do everything.
VU: Hospitalist teams do all the "less educational" stuff and take care of COVID-19 pts


## COVID-19 testing
VA: Cepheid Rapid Test in-house, Abbott m2000 (gold-standard for PCR-based COVID-19, sent to Lexinton, KY - will call if +)
VU: in-house PCR

*both PCR-based, nasopharyngeal swabs, varying turn-around times
