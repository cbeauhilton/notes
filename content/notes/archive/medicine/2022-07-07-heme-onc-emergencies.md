# Hematology and Oncology Emergencies


## c/f APL

Gen approach:

- page path resident, talk ASAP
    - if c/f APL by morphology: ATRA 22.5 mg/m2 q12h, FISH AML panel (write "PML-RARA testing STAT")
    - call smear lab to send you a picture, clarify that you are NOT the path resident, this is for academic interest
- call attg
- flow cytometry STAT
- TLS, DIC labs q6-8
- order PICC
- start fluids (~125cc/hr)
- start allopurinol 300mg BID (don't dose reduce for TLS)
- start hydrea 1g PO q12h


## TLS

- best tx is ppx w IVF+allopurinol
- don't adjust allopurinol, give 300mg BID
- if uric acid >9, give rasburicase 3mg IV
- start phos binder prn
- tx hyperK


## DIC

Most guidelines developed for pts w APL

- tfx 10u cryo for fibrinogen <150 (if non-APL consider <100)
- if INR elev, give vitK 10mg IV
- plt goal >20k, generally speaking


## Hyperleukocytosis

- WBC >100k w 50k blasts generally, but really a clinical dx
- type of cell matters (really the blasts, leukostasis v rare in e.g. CLL)
- start hydrea 2g q8h
- at VUMC: leukapheresis if symptomatic (nephro will do it, admit to MICU)
- call Holly Casanova for cell collection (even if middle of the night), sign consent next morning


## SVC syndrome

- "Terrible Ts"
- managed by not med onc (rad onc, IR, vascular, etc.). 
- but, we can help: rec TLS labs, AFP, bHCG, elevate HOB, consider diuresis, try to get bx (if asymptomatic, can be ok to d/c but schedule bx/PET *before* sending home), start heparin drop if clear thrombus
- ok to start steroids if needed (e.g. 10mg load then 4q6), airway is more important than bx yield, but do not start empirically
- also ok to radiate to control hemoptysis, etc. (usu 1-3 fx can control bleeding, regardless of tumor type - do not need tissue first)


## Acute Chest Syndrome

New opacity on CXR and pretty much any thoracic sx, also fever.

- r/o PE w CTA
- start abx (infx could mimic or precipitate ACS)
- order Hgb S level (gets drawn in the morning, helps transfusion medicine know how to exchange)

- option 1 (typically less sick, ~2L O2): transfuse blood alone (1-2u RBC, dilutes sickle cells, do not exceed Hgb 10)
- option 2 (sick): exchange transfusion (transfuse up to a reasonable Hgb, transfusion medicine helps manage - page blood bank path resident, happens in MICU).
    - Goal Hgb S <30%


## Hypercalcemia

- aggressive IVF
- goal uop 100-150cc/hr
- zometa 4mg IV over 15 min, no attg approval needed, no renal adjustment. Takes 2-4d for peak effect
- calcitonin if encephalopathic, needs attg approval, tachyphylaxis at ~48h


## Spinal cord compression

- NSGY, rad-onc c/s
- ok to wait for surgery or at least c/s prior to high dose steroids if sx onset slow
- consider PSA, SPEP/SLC, CT CAP
- typical dosing: dex 10mg IV loading then 4mg q6h
- if prostate cancer: consider degarilex now to prevent spike w leupron


## ITP

ddx if plt <5:

- platelet clumping
- HIT (less likely, few HIT pts have plt <5)
- TTP (less likely)
- severe DIC
- alloimmunization in heavily pre-transfused

order:

- citrated plt count
- smear (r/o clumping, r/o schistocytes/helmet cells/sharp/jagged cells)
- 1u plt, w 60min post-check (if still <5, dx of ITP)
- IPF - not harmful to dx, but certain ITP subtypes can attack plt in the marrow so have a low IPF

if dx:

- IVIG 1g/kg q24h x2 (response w/in 24-48h)
- dex 40mg PO x4d (~10 pills) (better than 1mg/kg pred in pIII trial, blood 2016, CR rate ~50%)


## TTP

- admit to MICU
- if PLEX w be delayed, can give FFP (also has ADAMTS-13)
- obtain ADAMTS-13 activity level (for dx TTP must be <10%, will be low in most sick pts but not that low), will reflex to inhibitor testing (which can change mgmt)
- pred 1mg/kg
- PLEX - talk to nephro fellow
- ADAMTS-13 testing is fraught, difficult, can be mildly effected by FFP (inhibitor will deactivate ADAMTS-13 in FFP)

## irAE

- always send to ED if at all concerned, need stat imaging, pred
- pneumonitis: abx, pulm c/s to consider bronchoscopy
- colitis: depends on sx, # bowel movements
    - <4BM/day: antidiarrheals at home
    - 4-6: pred 1mg/kg daily, send stool studies
    - >6: send to ED, start IV methylpred 1-2mg/kg daily
