# sleep

## sleep in residency
- Where are residents in terms of sleepiness?
    - Residents have Epworth Sleepiness Scale ratings
higher on average than people with obstructive sleep apnea
but lower than people with narcolepsy.

- Environmental factors unmask but do not cause sleepiness
    - i.e. it's not the lecture that put you to sleep,
you were sleepy and the lecture gave you an opportunity to sleep

- Sleep hygiene
    - "Practice gratitude at bed, not worries"
    - Pager and cell phone *off* when sleeping

- Melatonin
    - ideally, take 12h before desired waking time (take at 5pm if 5am wakeup is desired)
