On my way back to PHX, this time for an interview at UofA.

Excited to see fam,
also get the X220 going (writing this on the 2011 macbook).

As of now, top programs are:
1. UPMC (pitt)
2. URMC (rochester)
3. VUMC (vandy - haven't yet interviewed, maybe will jump to 1 or 2)
4. CCF (haven't yet interviewed, but will likely remain #4 or go down)
5. UofA (interview 11-15)
7. UofU (interview 11-something_after_15)

Looking forward to finishing ASH poster, also readmission paper review.
Excited to write bone marrow failure manuscript.
Really enjoying this little NLP on Pycon vids project,
found the master repo with all the links to pretty much ever Pycon-esque vid ever,
all on GitHub in JSON format.
Probs a waste of time, but if I find anything cool it would be good to submit to Pycon
(it's in Pittsburgh in 2020, but in April so Lori might just kill me...).
