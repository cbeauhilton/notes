I think I'm close to a comfortable place with Vimwiki.
Still many enhancements to be made, but maybe not?
E.g. I considered making a Vimwiki -> Jekyll workflow,
but the more I think about it the more I'm convinced it's better to
keep these separate and migrate material as it makes sense
(use the Vimwiki for a personal wiki,
private Git repo,
and when stuff is interesting enough to share then y/p the relevant parts).

This is my first diary entry, btw.
