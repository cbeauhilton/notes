# troff_vs_tex_vs_pro_typographers

This article and the discussion below is one of the best examples of what the Internet is for: http://web.archive.org/web/20150417042513/http://typophile.com/node/43702 .

and gets a discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of these software, and of WYSIWYG tools (a la InDesign).
