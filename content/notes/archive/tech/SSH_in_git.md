# ssh_in_git
:git:ssh:

Entering one's passphrase/password every time a commit is pushed is annoying. Github has a nice guide for setting up SSH access and SSH-agent: https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh .

I need to figure out how to make it automatically sign in to SSH-agent when I unlock the computer.

I think I got it working with these instructions: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/339840/how-to-start-and-use-ssh-agent-as-systemd-service
