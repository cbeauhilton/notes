Getting the visualizer to work in ncmpcpp was a pain, followed the instructions on the
[Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Ncmpcpp)
and made the /etc/mpd.conf and ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf match (at least the parts shown in the wiki , I left everything else alone),
and copied the stuff from the Arch wiki into the ~/.config/ncmpcpp/config file,
making sure all the other instances of those settings were commented out.

BTW, I really like that the ncmpcpp config file is also the manual,
but it makes scrolling through it a bit tedious, so I'm plus/minus on that way of doing things.
