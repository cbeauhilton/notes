# blarbs
I decided to fork Luke Smith's LARBS setup.
I was hesitant at first, mostly because they are still making pretty frequent updates, and I don't want to go through the trouble of updating mine to match theirs, plus my own edits.
After a while I realized that there's really nothing super broken in LARBS as it is, so I might as well get on with forking it before my X220 arrives.
There's also a bunch of stuff I will be removing (e.g. all the special character bindings in the .vimrc). I want to keep some of the rad things, like leader-c for compiling all the things, and the overall workflow and aesthetic, but take things apart, understand how they work, and optimize them for my own stuff (i.e. I do a lot of Python programming, and use Jekyll rather than Luke's minimalist wubsite thing).

BTW, Serge Gainsbourg is a hoot.
