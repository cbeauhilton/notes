# professional identity

## awkward transitions
Medical school, especially at the end, is awkward - you're giving orders, but can't really,
carrying patients, but not really, etc.
You can do a lot of good, but are purposefully (and thankfully) handicapped.

To what degree is residency similarly awkward?
Full MD/DO, can write orders, but still heavily (thankfully) supervised.

## motivation
Daniel Pink's Drive: autonomy, mastery, purpose (these map to Cal Newport's[^cn3] autonomy, competence, connection)

### autonomy
See "awkward transitions"

### mastery
Can't ever fully master medicine,
as it's too large (even if scientific knowledge remained static),
and scientific knowledge is exponentially expanding.
The joyfulness of infinite play lies in learning to start something we cannot finish.
See [Carse's _Finite and Infinite Games_](finite_infinite_games_james_p_carse.md).

### purpose
Work-life integration, rather than balance.
Regain purpose with self-care,
meaningful problems,
surround yourself with great colleagues.



[^cn3]: he didn't make these up, of course, and both Pink and Newport are popularizing large and deep academic fields
