## Strategy
- Lead out with MCQs
	- MKSAP x1.5
		- 2020 MCQs
		- one pass plus repeat missed ones
	- Do the practice exams when the regular sessions are done
## Tactics
### Do MCQs. Lots of MCQs.

- MKSAP: 2070 MCQs
	- They add more fairly often, so round up to 2100
- Calculate number of working days until the exam
	- not counting the weekends gives a nice buffer 
	- doing some questions on the weekends is not a bad idea, but will take some real holidays as well

- Subtract ~1mo (of working days) to reserve that time for redoing questions/consolidation/whatever clinical time they make me do:

- As of  2024-03-28:
	- 108 working days until 2024-08-28
	- 86 working days until 2024-07-29 
- 2100 MCQs/86 working days: 24.4186 MCQs/working day. Round up to 25.
	- to meet this number, there won't be time for much Anki or extensive notes. Save that for the onc boards. MKSAP has built-in spaced repetition for the stuff you don't know, since you can redo the missed ones.
	- Every spare moment with a phone in hand and nothing else that has to be done should be devoted to questions until the daily quota is met. 
- Recalculate as desired to track progress and adjust:
	- As of 2024-04-04:
		- 81 working days until 2024-07-29
		- 2070 - 195 = 1875
		- 1875/81 = 23.15
