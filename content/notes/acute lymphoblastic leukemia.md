##  overview of ALL

- PB flow: MPO -ve, TDT+, look for CD19, CD20, CD22 (see tx below)
- BMBx, excisional LN bx
- cyto (e.g. if Ph+ may add TKI)
- PCR: typically BCR-ABL p190, can also have p210, p230
	- order p190, p210
	- p190 typically acute (shorter)
	- p210 typically chronic
- CNS eval and tx
- JCO 2010 MD Anderson study on Ritux: used % positivity of CD20 (>20%) as inclusion, in practice no % positivity is reported out

- add targeted therapies based on findings
	- e.g. CD20+ -> rituximab, Ph+ -> TKI
	- my first ALL pt had Ph+, CD20+, so got R-HyperCVAD/MA+TKI

## approach to therapy

- CD19: blinutumomab, CAR-T
- CD20: rituximab
- CD22: inotuzumab ozogamicin
- if age <40: (R)HyperCVAD/MA(+TKI) -> cure ~50% if able to tolerate tx, MRD -ve after first induction
- blinutumomab, inotuzumab viewed as bridge to transplant, used in salvage
- if targeted therapy available (e.g. dasatinib), typically add back targeted agent s/p SCT at D+101. 
	- BiTE/CAR-T recommended against s/p SCT unless major relapse, as likelihood of clinically significant GVHD is worrisome.
- Kantarjian, Lancet Onc 2018, pII MD Anderson: >60, Ph-, hyper-mini-CVD + inotuzumab. Not a comparative study. In practice, inotuzumab has significant hepatotoxicity, etc,. so often skipped or used in a reduced fashion.
