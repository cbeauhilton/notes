# mistakes and systems

Looking for systems that allowed for mistakes is a great idea,
and [[Don Norman]] and [[Atul Gawande]] have done beautiful work
defining this generally (Norman) and for medicine (Gawande).
Blame and fix systems, and allow people to thrive.

What are the limits of system thinking?
Where is the boundary between personal responsibility and systemic responsibility?
Does the "an explanation is not a justification" idea dovetail into this?
