	- Deliberate spaced repetition
		- Anki
	- Incidental spaced repetition
		- all the stuff in Incidental above

## Strategy
- Lead out with MCQs
	- HOQ x1-2 
		- ~2000 MCQs
		- no way to just redo missed ones, but the writeups are good overviews anyway
		- Anki prn (only the thing(s) that would have helped you get the question right, or are clearly essential and likely to be tested in other ways)
		- Notes - dump for other interesting things from the MCQ reading, but don't make these pretty nor think too much about them. You'll get bogged down otherwise.
	- ASCO SEP x1.5 
		- ~1000 MCQs
		- one pass plus repeat missed ones
		- Anki and notes as above
	- Do the practice exams when the regular sessions are done
		- Anki and notes as above
- Use multimedia as consolidation after completing MCQ sections
	- MDA x1 (~28h total)
		- notes, grab the best bits out for Anki
	- FoC/TOD (ongoing, many hours)
		- the show notes for FoC are primo
		- notes/Anki prn
- Incidental learning
	- FoC/TOD
		- listen sequentially as they come out
	- Other incidental learning (reading literature for a specific patient, looking through JCO when it comes out, giving a presentation, adding ideas and facts from these things to your notes, etc.), may or may not help much with the exam. Don't Anki this stuff too much, not yet. Keep the flashcards focused on breezing through the exam, then make them more interesting as time goes on.

## Tactics
### Do MCQs. Lots of MCQs.

- Add up the number of questions to be completed in the first pass
	- HOQ: 1989 (the other advertised 600+ MCQs to equal "2500+" are either in the exams or benign heme sections)
	- ASCO SEP: ">900"
	- Round up: 3000 total
- Calculate number of working days until the exam
	- not counting the weekends gives a nice buffer 
	- doing some questions on the weekends is not a bad idea, but will take some real holidays as well
	- Anki sessions should continue on the weekends, ideally short reviews. Don't feel pressured to complete all scheduled reviews, especially at the beginning.

- Subtract ~3mo (of working days) to reserve that time for redoing questions/consolidation/starting in private practice: 
	- https://www.weeksuntil.com/working-days/date/2025/july/8
- As of  2024-03-28:
	- 398 working days until 2025-10-08
	- 332 working days until 2025-07-08 
- 3000 MCQs/332 working days: 9.036 MCQs/working day. Round up to 10.
	- This is a reasonable number to allow for making cards and watching videos. It will probably be a few dozen on some days and just a few on others.
	- Every missed question should get a card. Even if there's a card on this subject already, you missed something and need the review, maybe from a slightly different angle. The card should only cover what you needed to know to get the question right but didn't. The multimedia resources (and the rest of your life and learning) are for context.
	- It's ok to dump stuff you just can't help wanting to collect into notes, but be quick about it (e.g. trial links and key data).
- Recalculate as desired to track progress and adjust.

### Watch videos

- as above, as consolidation after MCQs

### Listen to podcasts

- When the current book series you're listening to has finished (as of 2024-03-28, 33 hours remain), start at the first episode of FoC and listen until current. I know you've heard more than half of them before. That's good, you need the review.
- When you've caught up on FoC, listen to TOD until current.
- Then, listen to whatever you want, but stop and switch over when:
	- a new episode of FoC or TOD comes out
	- you would benefit from reviewing a particular episode in relation to MCQs or some other reason (e.g. a clinic block)
- Stopping to switch over might be tough if you're into a long, awesome audiobook series. Prefer books that come in singlets for the next year or so.
