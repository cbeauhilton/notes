# chemotherapy overview

## [[anthracyclines]]
- naturally occuring ("bicin", "mycin")
- ~8 proposed MOA
- limited by:
	- myelosuppression
	- cardiotoxicity (lifetime limits on doses)

[[dirty data]], [[adverse effects]] [[risk mitigation]]: often the total lifetime dose of [[anthracyclines]] is unknown, e.g. they had treatment elsewhere and records are sparse. Try to figure out the regimen they got, and use the highest dose of anthracycline in that regimen as if they got the full planned dose.
