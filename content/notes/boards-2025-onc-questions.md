Q: Since DestinyBreast03 established Enhertu as way better than TDM-1, when do we use TDM-1?
A: Multiple reasons, but the one that makes most sense to me is major TRAE to Enhertu. I wouldn't think that TDM-1 would be expected to work after Enhertu failure, but if you're unable to get the full course of Enhertu, might be worth a shot. Also indicated as an adjuvant therapy after incomplete response to a HER2-targeting agent.
