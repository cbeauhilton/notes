The [[Commonplace Book]] is not so much "commonplace" as it is a "common place" for gathering ideas.

From [[loci communes]] of antiquity (maybe related to the memory palace?),
to the Medieval [[florilegium]], or "gathering of flowers,"
which were scrapbooks of religious themes,
and on around to Ryan Holiday's shoebox of 3x5 notecards,
it is essentially a homemade thought bank from which to withdraw and deviously employ someone else's hard-earned insights.
