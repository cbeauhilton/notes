"...overall HPV prevalence in OPSCC is increasing significantly over time: 

from 40.5% before 2000, 
to 64.3% between 2000 and 2004, 
and 72.2% between 2005 and 2009"

questions, probably won't be answered for decades:
- what will the dropoff in sexual activity over the past decade or so do to these numbers? (don't have a reference for this, heard a few times that teens are having less sex, also not sure if this translates into young adults)
- ditto for the HPV vaccine

questions that probably have an answer:
- what's the average lead time from contracting HPV to getting OPSCC?
