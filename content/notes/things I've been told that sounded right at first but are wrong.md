## "Technology moves fast. You really think you'll be writing [programming language x] in 10 years? No way."

This is patently untrue. 
Sure, niche languages are niche, 
and may be so niche that it will be difficult 
(but I doubt impossible) to find meaningful projects written in them 20 years later,
but popular languages get a grip on the world that never completely goes away.
The [[Lindy effect]] is in full force - 
the older a technology becomes, 
the longer its expected remaining life span.

- My [[window manager]] and many other continually great basic computing tools are written in C, which has been around (continually updated, but around - this is true for all of the following, they are not static over the decades) since 1972. 
- The Structured Query Language ([[SQL]]), the lingua franca of data analysis, whose importance only grows with the years, first appeared in 1974. (the two relational databases based on SQL I use most:  PostgreSQL: 1996, SQLite: 2000)
- The Bourne shell, whose scripting language and its descendants glue all of computing together, started life in 1976 and was officially released in 1979.
- Python was released in 1991.
- R came around in 1993. 
- JavaScript: 1995. (JSON: 2001)

Etc.

The impetus for the wrong statement 
was probably something about staying flexible 
and not getting too pigeonholed into a single language, 
which is not a bad sentiment overall. 
However, the other side of it, 
that it may not  make sense to deeply learn a programming language 
because it will go away and you'll have useless skills, is short-sighted.

Even if one of the above languages goes out of vogue 
(seems unlikely any time soon),
the primitives, structures, and styles will live on,
either by imitation or purposeful contradistinction (cf. Rust),
such that the experience gained will be continually put to good use.

The question of whether to learn programming at all is more interesting,
and is about opportunity cost,
but I done spent that opportunity cash a long time ago and am quite pleased with the returns on my continued monthly installments.
