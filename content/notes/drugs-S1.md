Mechanism:
- Oral fluoropyrimidine
- 5-FU prodrug tegafur (ftorafur, FT) combined with two other drugs, gimeracil, a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase inhibitor (competitive inhibitor of DPD, reduces drug breakdown in the GI tract) and oteracil (prevents 5-FU phosphorylation in the GI tract, so has less n/v/d and stomatitis)
- toxicity profiles differ across CYP2A6 polymorphisms: 
	- CYP2A6 polymorphisms more common in Asian countries lead to lower conversion of FT to FU
	- this bears out in clinical studies: in Asian countries, recommended daily doses are 80-120mg/d with myelosuppression as the most severe toxicity, whereas in Western countries, recommended daily doses are 50-80mg and diarrhea is the most severe toxicity. (Asia: 40mg/m2 BID, West: 30mg/m2 BID. I wonder how much that scales with obesity, if at all). Doesn't seem that the oteracil helps Westerners with GI tox much, which I'm guessing is why S1 hasn't made it across the ocean.
	- However! The SALTO study in the Netherlands compared capecitabine with S1 in 1L monotherapy for mCRC, N=161, and had comparable efficacy with much less hand-foot syndrome (45% vs 73%, though higher high-grade anorexia (13% vs 3%), but overall a better ability to maintain dose intensity. https://doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdx122. 
	- Maybe we'll eventually get it in the West, if things like SALTO keep happening. It would be nice to have it available, either for everybody (for the HFS benefit, either 1L or if capecitabine becomes intolerable - it looks like the Dutch are using S1, with success, for folks who have bad HFS on capecitabine: https://doi.org/10.1080/0284186X.2016.1278459) or as an option with pts with the right CYP2A6 to suggest they'd reap all the benefits.

Tegafur with uracil (UFT) is also widely used in other countries, idk if there's any head-to-head data comparing S1 with UFT.
