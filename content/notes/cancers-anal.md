## local

- >90% of anal cancers are local/locoregional at dx
- SCC vs adeno: adeno has a worse prognosis (7% CR with CCR alone), so treated more aggressively, more similar to rectal adeno. Rectal adeno T3+ or any N+ usually gets total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT: CCR and chemo alone prior to surgery).
		- NCSB study: https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.2076
		- surgery: mOS 78mo
		- surgery w adj CRT: mOS 83mo
		- neoadj CRT w surgery: mOS 92mo
		- CRT: mOS 36mo
- surveillance after definitive therapy
	- q3mo until NED, then anoscopy q6-12mo x3y. 
	- if stage II or III, add CT CAP w IV con q12mo.
	- abdominoperineal resection should be offered for local recurrence (5y OS 64% - https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-006-9221-7. Metastatic recurrence is ~10%.)
		- ?lookup: do we also give chemo in this setting? 
### studies
- [[SCC]] s/p CRT
	- ACT-II. 
		- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28209296
		- 29% of pts who were not in CR at 11wks were in CR at 26wks. 
		- Implications/practical considerations:
			- No need to jump to surgery if there is residual at the 3mo checkup.
			- As long as there's not frank POD, continue q3mo checks until either POD or CR.
- SCC T2-4, N0+
		- RTOG 98-11. 
			- https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2012.43.8085
			- RT+FU+MMC CCR vs induction FU/Cis + FU+Cis CCR. I don't think there are any studies that look at FU+Cis w/o induction.
			- RT+FU+MMC CCR is better and easier.
			- 5y DFS 67.8% vs 57.8%; 5y OS 78.3% vs 70.7%. 
			- Colostomy-free survival had a P value of exactly 0.05, HR 1.29 w CI 0.99-1.67, so was considered "trending toward significance" in favor of better CFS in the MMC group. (106/325 vs 132/324 needed colostomies).
