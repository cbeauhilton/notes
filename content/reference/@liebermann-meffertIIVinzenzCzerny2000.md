> [!abstract]-
> Vinzenz Czerny, chairman and professor of surgery in Freiburg im Breisgau and in Heidelberg, Germany, is the typical example of a prominent surgeon with an elegant technique, who was also a keen observer and scientist at the turn of the nineteenth into the early twentieth century. Starting his career in Vienna, Austria, he can be looked upon as the most important disciple of Theodor Billroth. Whereas Billroth may be regarded as the father of modern gastrointestinal surgery, Czerny can be considered the father of modern surgery for intestinal malignancies and multimodal treatment. The early history of visceral cancer therapy is linked with his career. He became a surgeon of the highest rank, with great clinical skill, rare judgment, and vision who contributed essentially to the development of modern surgery. From his early education he maintained a lifelong affection for the natural sciences and was an excellent physiologist and pathologist. During his professional life he successfully built up a well deserved reputation for general and cancer surgery and for the introduction of radio- and chemotherapy into the treatment of tumors. Czerny founded and chaired the first experimental Institute for Cancer Research in Germany. Two years later, in 1908, he presided at the 2nd Congress of the International Society of Surgery/Société Internationale de Chirurgie (ISS/SIC) in Brussels, a congress that was almost entirely devoted to the etiology of visceral cancer and the progress and achievements of its treatment. Czerny left a clear legacy of opinion and methods on which the modern era of surgical cancer treatment is based.
