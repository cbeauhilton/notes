> [!abstract]-
> Vincenz Czerny, as a pupil of Theodor Billroth and as head of the surgical departments of the Universities of Freiburg and Heidelberg between 1871 and 1906, markedly influenced the surgical development of the 19th century. Major contributions to the field of surgery included hernia operations, abdominal surgery and vaginal hysterectomy. Most importantly he recognized that surgery alone would not be able to control cancer and he developed concepts for multimodality treatment.

- ~ pc After 1900 he expanded his interest in adjuvant and additional therapies including serum therapy, vaccination, electrotherapy and radiation. [Zotero, p. 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CQDQ85CH?page=2&annotation=ZBUIR9XP) ^ZBUIR9XP
	- some of the earliest multimodality therapies were attempts at IO
- ~ pc Its modern variant, intraoperative radiotherapy, was reintroduced 85 years later in Heidelberg in June 1991. [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CQDQ85CH?page=3&annotation=E7CLBGT6) ^E7CLBGT6
	- aha, intraop RT took over

- % rf Beck described the palliative procedure of suturing non-resectable carcinomas into the abdominal wall to allow direct irradiation of the tumour without affecting surrounding structures.4.5 [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CQDQ85CH?page=3&annotation=9HY46C2J) ^9HY46C2J
	- whoa, do we ever do this any more? I'm guessing RT is now so much better that it's not necessary, and would probably ruin the abdominal wall at the RT location anyway, but what a cool idea.
