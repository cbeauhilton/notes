- [[HPV+ OPSCC incidence over time]]
- "...overall HPV prevalence in OPSCC is increasing significantly over time: 
- from 40.5% before 2000, 
	to 64.3% between 2000 and 2004, 
	and 72.2% between 2005 and 2009"
- "age at OPSCC diagnosis is increasing for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients, and a rising proportion of older patients have HPV-positive tumors"

- [[OPSCC HPV+ survival ]]
- overall, HPV+ OPSCC has better outcomes than HPV- OPSCC
- age matters: HPV+ pts >=70yo have similar survival to HPV- pts 50-59yo

- [[HNSCC timeline of therapies]]
- 1960s: MTX for recurrent or metastatic disease
- 1970s, early: [[MTX]] vs [[cisplatin]] as part of a combined approach for stage IV, M1, recurrent w/o option for salvage
	- cisplatin single-agent RR 14-41% (higher if prev untx)
- 1970s, late: cisplatin+[[bleomycin]], then added MTX or [[vinca_alkaloids]], then progressed to cisplatin+[[5-FU]]
	- 1977 Wayne State started a series of pilot studies, non-RCT:
	- prev untx, cisplatin+[[vincristine]]+bleomycin, RR 80%, CR 29%. 
	- bc bleomycin had so much pulm tox and cis+5-FU ([[CF_PF]]) was the new hotness, follow-up study used CF (2 cycles, C 100mg/m2 D1, F 1000mg/m2/day x96h): RR 88%, CR 19%.
	- CF regimen then changed to run over 120h (another 1g of F) and 3 cycles: RR 93%, CR 38%
	- final CF regimen repeated by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ([[RTOG]]): RR 86%, CR 38%.
	- next study tried to increase cisplatin, but no benefit was shown
- 1980s (1979-1987): 
	- 5x RCT w MTX, 4/5 -ve for survival
		- 1/5 +ve: gave [[intra-arterial]] MTX, benefit only present in stage II oral cavity cancer
	- other RCTs done, all -ve (again other than one study, a different one, that also used intra-arterial chemo and only showed benefit in oral cavity cancer)
	- noted that pts who responded well to chemo also responded well to RT
- 1990s: [[CCRT]]
	- this paper uses CCRT to mean, specifically, "Concurrent Cisplatin-based chemoRadiotherapy"
	- CCRT used adjuvantly for unfavorable surgical results (R+, extracapsular extension), definitively for unresectable disease
- 2000s: targeted therapy, IO, [[taxanes]]
	- two main RCTs, one in US and one in Europe, added [[docetaxel]] == [[TPF]]
	- TPF worked better than PF (see image below), more tolerable, cost-effective. 
	- ~75% completed TPF+RT per protocol, ~25% had treatment delays during TPF
	- did not answer whether [[ICT]]+CCRT vs CCRT alone is better, and incidences of toxicities with ICT+CCRT is higher than with CCRT alone (febrile 11%, "toxic death" up to 6%)
	- European TPF ([[TAX323_EORTC24971]]): 
		- 3 cycles
		- docetaxel 75mg/m2 x1
		- cisplatin 75mg/m2 x1
		- 5-FU 750mg/m2/day x5d (3750mg)
		- only prev untx, unresectable LA-HNSCC
		- RT afterward (4-7wks) if no disease progression, dealer's choice RT protocol (66-74 Gy in various fractionation schema)
		- Resection before or after RT, dealer's choice and clinical situation
	- American TPF ([[TAX324]]): 
		- 4 cycles
		- docetaxel 75mg/m2 x1
		- cisplatin 100mg/m2 x1
		- 5-FU 1000mg/m2/day x4d (4000mg)
		- prev untx, unresectable/low likelihood of surgical cure, and pts who were candidates for organ preservation
		- CCRT afterward (3-8wks), 70-74Gy + carbo AUC 1.5 x7wks
		- Resection 6-12wk s/p CCRT if resectable disease (e.g. not CR)

- [[ICT LA-HNSCC indications]]
	- larynx preservation
	- treatment intensification (?)
	- borderline resectable or unresectable *oral cavity* cancer
	- selection tool for RT dose de-escalation in HPV+ OPSCC
	- oligometastatic disease
