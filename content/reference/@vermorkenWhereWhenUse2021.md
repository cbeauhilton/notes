> [!abstract]-
> The treatment of locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-HNSCC) is reviewed, highlighting the milestones in systemic therapy in that setting, with focus on the role of induction chemotherapy (ICT). The road to what is now considered the standard ICT regimen, i.e. the TPF (docetaxel/cisplatin/5-FU) regimen is described, and the differences between the European and the American TPF are discussed. The article describes the respective roles of ICT for larynx preservation, for treatment intensification, its role in patients with borderline resectable or unresectable oral cavity cancer, its role as a selection tool for radiotherapy dose de-escalation in patients with oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC) and its potential future role in strategies aiming at synchronous oligometastatic disease.

## [[HPV+ OPSCC incidence over time]]
- "...overall HPV prevalence in OPSCC is increasing significantly over time: 
- from 40.5% before 2000, 
	to 64.3% between 2000 and 2004, 
	and 72.2% between 2005 and 2009"
- "age at OPSCC diagnosis is increasing for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients, and a rising proportion of older patients have HPV-positive tumors"

## [[OPSCC HPV+ survival ]]
- overall, HPV+ OPSCC has better outcomes than HPV- OPSCC
- age matters: HPV+ pts >=70yo have similar survival to HPV- pts 50-59yo

- [[HNSCC timeline of therapies]]
- 1960s: MTX for recurrent or metastatic disease
- 1970s, early: [[MTX]] vs [[cisplatin]] as part of a combined approach for stage IV, M1, recurrent w/o option for salvage
	- cisplatin single-agent RR 14-41% (higher if prev untx)
- 1970s, late: cisplatin+[[bleomycin]], then added MTX or [[vinca_alkaloids]], then progressed to cisplatin+[[5-FU]]
	- 1977 Wayne State started a series of pilot studies, non-RCT:
	- prev untx, cisplatin+[[vincristine]]+bleomycin, RR 80%, CR 29%. 
	- bc bleomycin had so much pulm tox and cis+5-FU ([[CF_PF]]) was the new hotness, follow-up study used CF (2 cycles, C 100mg/m2 D1, F 1000mg/m2/day x96h): RR 88%, CR 19%.
	- CF regimen then changed to run over 120h (another 1g of F) and 3 cycles: RR 93%, CR 38%
	- final CF regimen repeated by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ([[RTOG]]): RR 86%, CR 38%.
	- next study tried to increase cisplatin, but no benefit was shown
- 1980s (1979-1987): 
	- 5x RCT w MTX, 4/5 -ve for survival
		- 1/5 +ve: gave [[intra-arterial]] MTX, benefit only present in stage II oral cavity cancer
	- other RCTs done, all -ve (again other than one study, a different one, that also used intra-arterial chemo and only showed benefit in oral cavity cancer)
	- noted that pts who responded well to chemo also responded well to RT
- 1990s: [[CCRT]]
	- this paper uses CCRT to mean, specifically, "Concurrent Cisplatin-based chemoRadiotherapy"
	- CCRT used adjuvantly for unfavorable surgical results (R+, extracapsular extension), definitively for unresectable disease
- 2000s: targeted therapy, IO, [[taxanes]]
	- two main RCTs, one in US and one in Europe, added [[docetaxel]] == [[TPF]]
	- TPF worked better than PF (see image below), more tolerable, cost-effective. 
	- ~75% completed TPF+RT per protocol, ~25% had treatment delays during TPF
	- did not answer whether [[ICT]]+CCRT vs CCRT alone is better, and incidences of toxicities with ICT+CCRT is higher than with CCRT alone (febrile 11%, "toxic death" up to 6%)
	- European TPF ([[TAX323_EORTC24971]]): 
		- 3 cycles
		- docetaxel 75mg/m2 x1
		- cisplatin 75mg/m2 x1
		- 5-FU 750mg/m2/day x5d (3750mg)
		- only prev untx, unresectable LA-HNSCC
		- RT afterward (4-7wks) if no disease progression, dealer's choice RT protocol (66-74 Gy in various fractionation schema)
		- Resection before or after RT, dealer's choice and clinical situation
	- American TPF ([[TAX324]]): 
		- 4 cycles
		- docetaxel 75mg/m2 x1
		- cisplatin 100mg/m2 x1
		- 5-FU 1000mg/m2/day x4d (4000mg)
		- prev untx, unresectable/low likelihood of surgical cure, and pts who were candidates for organ preservation
		- CCRT afterward (3-8wks), 70-74Gy + carbo AUC 1.5 x7wks
		- resection 6-12wk s/p CCRT if resectable disease (e.g. not CR)
		- because of increased toxicities with TPF, modified regimens have been tried:
			- [[modified TPF]]: Fayette J, Fontaine-Delaruelle C, Ambrun A, et  al. Neoadjuvant modified TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, fluorouracil) for patients unfit to standard TPF in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: a study of 48 patients. Oncotarget. 2016;7:37297–304.
			- [[weekly carbo+taxol]]: Herman LC, Chen L, Garnett A, et  al. Comparison of carboplatin-paclitaxel to docetaxelcisplatin-5-fluorouracil induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiation for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Oral Oncol. 2014;50:52–8.
			- [[TPEx]] (cisplatin, docetaxel, cetuximab): Zenda S, Ota Y, Kiyota N, et al. A multicenter phase II trial of docetaxel, cisplatin, and cetuximab (TPEx) followed by cetuximab and concurrent radiotherapy for patients with local advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (CSPOR HN01: ECRIPS study). Front. Oncologia. 2019;9:6.

- [[ICT LA-HNSCC indications]]
	- larynx preservation
		- unknown if ICT vs CCRT for pts with LA-HNSCC  is better for larynx preservation for who were eligible for total laryngectomy
		- SALTORL trial (GORTEX 2014-03) is comparing these head-to-head
		- 
	- treatment intensification (?)
		- OS doesn't differ between ICT and CCRT, but
			- ICT improves the rate of distant mets
			- CCRT improves locoregional control
	- borderline resectable or unresectable *oral cavity* cancer
		- if resectable, ICT doesn't help
		- if borderline resectable, ~30% of pts can convert to resectable with a few rounds of ch
	- selection tool for RT dose de-escalation in HPV+ OPSCC
		- the doses of RT that are used for CCRT are very high, much morbidity
	- oligometastatic disease
		- some hope that certain oligometastatic diseases can be cured, e.g. w ICT f/b immunotherapy
	- pragmatic
		- impeding airway compromise, nerve involvement
