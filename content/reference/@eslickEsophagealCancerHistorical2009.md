> [!abstract]-
> The history of esophageal cancer dates back to ancient Egyptian times, circa 3000 bc. Since then, the progress in the diagnosis and treatment of esophageal cancer has been steady. Over the last few centuries there have been advancements in the visualization and removal of these lesions, but with no real overall impact on survival rates. The twenty-first century is the time to make major progress in not only improving survival rates, but also in diagnosing esophageal cancer in the very early stages.

	- first upper esophageal resection (likely SCC given location)
- & sm 1886: J. Mikulicz treats esophageal carcinoma by resetion and plastic reconstruction. [Zotero, p. 2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=2&annotation=4DU44AF4) ^4DU44AF4

	- unsuccessful resections (R posterior mediastinotomy)
- & sm 1907: Wendell describes transpleural resection of an esophageal carcinoma of the lower esophagus with lateral esophagogastrostomy in a lumen (patient dies the following day). [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=3&annotation=3SESETBF) ^3SESETBF
	- unsuccessful resection (lateral esophagogastrostomy - surgery is technically successful but pt dies next day)
- & sm 1908: Volecker successfully resects a carcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction with primary esophagogastrostomy via laparotomy. [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=3&annotation=Q5Z2TYUQ) ^Q5Z2TYUQ

[Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=3&annotation=F8XKJ9QH) ^F8XKJ9QH
	- surgical advances, improved operative mortality (>50% operative mortality -> 17%-29% operative mortality), but very poor 5y OS (8% by 1947). Torek's midesophageal resection in 1913 yielded 13y of life for the pt.
- & sm 1963: Logan describes 853 resections for esophageal carcinoma (29% operative mortality). [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=3&annotation=WQJFCNT3) ^WQJFCNT3
	- Logan's operative mortality rate (29%) was higher than Sweet's (17%), but case load also much higher (853 vs 212)
- & sm 1978: Orringer and Sloan revive the technique of Gray Turner’s ‘‘esophagectomy without thoracotomy.’’ [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=3&annotation=HDWF5G58) ^HDWF5G58
	- esophagectomy without thoracotomy
- & sm 1984: Leichman and colleagues at Wayne State University combine 3,000 cGy with two cycles of 5-FU and cisplatin preoperatively in 21 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (37% pathologic complete response; operative mortality 27%). [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=3&annotation=YUERKQ8V) ^YUERKQ8V
	- trimodality therapy - 30 Gy + cis+5-FU neoadjuvant. 37% pCR, operative mortality 27%.
- & sm development of the esophagoscope. Adolf Kussmaul (1822–1902) (Fig. 9)9 introduced this revolutionary device in 1868 when he passed a lighted tube through the entire esophagus into the stomach of a patient. [Zotero, p. 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=11&annotation=QZXR27L4) ^QZXR27L4
	- esophagoscope 1868
- & sm 1877, Adolph Kussmaul’s son-in-law, Vincenz Czerny (1842–1916) (Fig. 11),11 performed the first successful human resection of the cervical esophagus, after conducting animal experiments where he had resected a carcinoma of the cervical esophagus that provided a 1-year survival. However, perhaps one of Czerny’s greatest proposals was that surgery alone would not be adequate for controlling cancer, leading to his development of concepts for multimodality treatment.12 [Zotero, p. 11](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=11&annotation=UKG8TTFV) ^UKG8TTFV
	- 1y survival for resection of cervical esophagus. Czerny was one of the first to use chemotherapy as well - Salvarsan, an antisyphilitic, appeared to work well in sarcomas. He also tried vaccines (early IO), and various approaches to RT.
- & sm several early successful attempts at esophageal resection and esophagectomy between 1909 and 1938 by surgeons in Germany,13 Japan (Oshawa),14 the United Kingdom (Evans, Lewis, Belsey),15,16 and the United States (Torek, Adams, Phemister).17–21 [Zotero, p. 12](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=12&annotation=8FKQZMFN) ^8FKQZMFN
	- good summary of surgeons in the early 1900s
- & sm Surgery has normally been considered as ‘‘the only option’’ for patients with early stage cancer of the esophagus, and it wasn’t until the mid-1980s that other combined therapy options became available to patients.24 These combinations of therapies, known as ‘‘multimodality therapy,’’ involve radiation, chemotherapy, or both before surgery for treatment of esophageal cancer. Unfortunately, even with these combined treatment options, the impact in terms of increased survival has not been impressive. [Zotero, p. 13](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=13&annotation=GQXAVSZW) ^GQXAVSZW
	- multimodality therapy introduced in 1980s, didn't move the needle much

## Connections, Agree, Disagree

- ~ lc The earliest reports of esophageal cancer in China appeared over 2000 years ago and were referred to as ‘‘Ye Ge,’’ which means dysphagia and belching [Zotero, p. 4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=4&annotation=9NA37S85) ^9NA37S85
	- China EC, with epidemiologic emphasis
- ~ pc The Spanish born Arabian physician Avenzoar (1090–1162), made several ingenious suggestions regarding cases of obstruction or of palsy of the gullet. He recommends treatment options that include ‘‘the introduction of food into the stomach by a silver tube and the use of nutritive enemata.’’ [Zotero, p. 6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=6&annotation=UFTB7RAR) ^UFTB7RAR
	- Arabian physician tx esophageal obstruction 1090-1162, feeding tubes/"nutritive enemata"
- ~ pc first Western description suggesting a link with a history of heavy drinking and the development of esophageal cancer was made by E.G. Gyser in his 1770 paper titled, ‘‘De fame lethali ex callosa oesophagi angustia.’’ [Zotero, p. 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=7&annotation=NC5AIYEV) ^NC5AIYEV
	- as usual, China was nearly 2000 years ahead of Europe
- ~ pc Howship was believed to also be one of the first from the Western world to report that esophageal cancer rarely develops in early life. [Zotero, p. 10](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=10&annotation=PW8KDXVD) ^PW8KDXVD
	- early 1800s, second epidemiological insight (EC usually in old age), obtained later in Europe than in China

- ? mt Diagnosis Thou shouldst say concerning him: ‘‘One having a wound in his throat, piercing through to his gullet. An ailment with which I will contend.’’ [Zotero, p. 3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=3&annotation=XIQJ9YGP) ^XIQJ9YGP
	- what a delightful phrase, "An ailment with which I will contend."
- ? mt At dinner I was almost choaked by swallowing a bit of a roasted mutton which as I thought stuck in the passage about the mouth of the stomach. But it suffered noething to goe downe and the stomach threw all up, though never soe small in quantitie, to all our amazements the sckilfull not knowing what 2 make of my condition. It being an unusuall afflixion wch. my melancholi suggested it an extraordinarie judgment. I could swallow about 2 spoonfulls about half way (as I thought) and then it would flush up in spite of my hart. Some small humidity or drops of what I dranck rather distilld or dropt into the stomach which afforded a bare living nourishment and on a sudden I grew lean as a skeleton and at some tymes very faint and feeble, although I recovered in some measure and had stomach 2 eate, my meate doeth noe gt. good and I am in a kind of atrophie. [Zotero, p. 7](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RSI6ESVM?page=7&annotation=PGPRZSUA) ^PGPRZSUA
	- a delightful description of a horrifying progression, written by a surgeon who died in 1691 (John Casaubon)
