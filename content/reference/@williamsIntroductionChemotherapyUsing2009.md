- ~ pc late 19th century, Paul Ehrlich (1854–1915) developed an early interest in the specific staining of tissues with dyes, first with methylene blue and then with trypan red and atoxyl. He reasoned this might allow the detection of a substance that would specifically bind to and kill microbes without harming human cells. After working initially under Robert Koch in Berlin, Ehrlich moved to his own institute in Frankfurt (Main). After it had been shown in 1905 that atoxyl, an arsenical, had some activity against trypanosomes, his chemists, led by Alfred Bertheim, synthesized a series of arsenical derivatives.

	- inspiration from dyes, noted that specific tissues take up dyes while others are left unaffected, so perhaps specific microbes would take up chemicals and be killed by them without harming the human host (1890 - methylene blue inspired the idea). Trypan red works well against trypanosomes (Ehrlich developed this from prior dyes, improving it by sulfurization). Atoxyl worked well but was toxic. Arsphenamine was synthesized as one of many attempts to improve arsenicals, and eventually found to work well. It was the SoC for syphilis from 1910 until penicillin took over after WWII.
