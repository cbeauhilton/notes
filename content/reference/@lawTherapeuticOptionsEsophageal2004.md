> [!abstract]-
> Options for the treatment of esophageal cancer used to be very limited, with surgical resection and radiotherapy methods aimed at both cure or palliation, and, in those unfortunate patients with severe dysphagia, intubation with a plastic prosthesis to restore esophageal luminal patency. Progress in the management of this cancer in the past two decades includes refinement in surgical techniques and perioperative care, better radiological staging methods, enhanced means of planning and delivering radiotherapy, multimodality treatments, and better designs in esophageal prosthesis. For individual patients, a stage-directed therapeutic plan can be used. Long-term survival, however, remains suboptimal for this deadly disease. The current review presents an overview of the commonly employed therapeutic options for esophageal cancer at the beginning of the 21st century.

- ~ pc Torek who in 1913 performed the first successful transthoracic resection.10 A 67-year-old woman had a squamous cell cancer of the mid-esophagus. Through a left thoracotomy, the esophagus was resected. The proximal cervical esophagus was brought out through an incision anterior to the stenocleidomastoid muscle and tunneled subcutaneously along the anterior chest wall, where a cutaneous esophagostomy was fashioned. The patient was fed via a rubber tube connecting the esophagostomy with a gastrostomy. The patient lived for another 13 years.

- ~ pc In 1940, Oschner and DeBakey reviewed the worldwide literature and collected reports of 191 esophageal resections with a 72% mortality rate.19 In the 1970s, an operability rate of 58%, resectability rate of 39%, and mortality from resection of 29% were documented.20 In the 1980s, a similar resectability rate (56%) was reported, but the mortality rate had dropped to 13%.21 A recent review of results from developed countries reported a mortality rate of 11% in studies from 1990 onwards.22 It is interesting to observe that mortality rates in China and Japan are, in general, lower than those in Western countries. Regardless of geography, however, in selected centers, a low mortality rate of less than 5% can be obtained.23–28 [Zotero, p. 5](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/LRQLL9VN?page=2&annotation=EPVMZYU2) ^EPVMZYU2
