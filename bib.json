  {"id":"dasChemotherapyNeuroendocrineTumors2021","abstract":"The role for cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) remains debated. Compared to patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) where chemotherapy is utilized ubiquitously, chemotherapy may play a more select role in patients with certain types of NETs (e.g., pancreatic tumors, higher grade tumors, and tumors possessing DNA damage repair defects). The primary types of chemotherapy that have been tested in patients with NETs include alkylating agent- and platinum agent-based combinations. Across regimens, chemotherapy appears to elicit greater antitumor activity in patients with pancreatic or grade 3 NETs. The role for chemotherapy in lower grade extra-pancreatic NETs remains undefined. Furthermore, while chemotherapy has demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit for patients in the systemic setting, its role in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is as-of-yet undetermined. Finally, efforts to combine chemotherapy with targeted therapy and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy are ongoing, in hopes of improving the cytoreductive treatment options for patients with NETs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Das","given":"Satya"},{"family":"Al-Toubah","given":"Taymeyah"},{"family":"Strosberg","given":"Jonathan"}],"citation-key":"dasChemotherapyNeuroendocrineTumors2021","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13194872","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,29]]},"language":"en","page":"4872","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chemotherapy in Neuroendocrine Tumors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/19/4872","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"dasNovelTherapeuticsPatients2021","abstract":"Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) represent the most common subtype of NETs. The incidence of all NETs, and specifically GEP NETs, has risen exponentially over the last three decades. Only within the past several years have these tumors been appropriately classified, allowing for meaningful drug development. Broadly, some of the most exciting drug classes being developed for patients with well-differentiated GEP NETs include newer types of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) or combinations which increase the potency of lutetium-177 (\n              177\n              Lu)-Dotatate, novel multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) and immunotherapy modalities, beyond checkpoint inhibitors, which seek to unleash the immune system against NETs. Specifically looking at newer types of PRRT, somatostatin receptor antagonists and alpha-emitter radionuclides each have demonstrated the ability to elicit greater DNA damage than\n              177\n              Lu-Dotatate in preclinical models. Early clinical experiences with each of these agents suggest they may be more cytotoxic than\n              177\n              Lu-Dotatate. Other approaches seeking to build upon the DNA damage created by\n              177\n              Lu-Dotatate include combinations of PRRT with radiosensitizers such as heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, hedgehog inhibitors, chemotherapy combinations, and triapine. Many of these combinations have just begun to be tested clinically. With regards to novel RTKIs, some of the ones which have demonstrated potent cytoreductive potential include cabozantinib and lenvatinib. Other RTKIs which are further along the clinical development spectrum and have demonstrated benefit in randomized trials include surufatinib and pazopanib. And though single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors have not demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patients with GEP NETs, outside of certain biomarker selected subsets, somatostatin receptor-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and vaccines such as SurVaxM, which targets survivin, represent two means through which NET-directed immunity may be modulated. The potential of these agents, if clinically realized, will likely improve outcomes for patients with well-differentiated GEP NETs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Das","given":"Satya"},{"family":"Dasari","given":"Arvind"}],"citation-key":"dasNovelTherapeuticsPatients2021","container-title":"Therapeutic Advances in Medical Oncology","container-title-short":"Ther Adv Med Oncol","DOI":"10.1177/17588359211018047","ISSN":"1758-8359, 1758-8359","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","page":"175883592110180","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Novel therapeutics for patients with well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17588359211018047","volume":"13"},
