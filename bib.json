Methods: A Medline search was performed looking for US based research on cervical cancer and social inequities since 1990. The papers found were organized into cells defined by a \"cancer disparities grid.\" Results: The majority of research published about cervical cancer and social inequities in the US, lies within the social domains of: race/ethnicity and socioeconomic position. Conflicting information exists as to whether race/ethnicity is a good predictor of screening and survival. Some research implied that differentials based on race/ethnicity are likely secondary to differentials in socioeconomic position. Some research about age, insurance status, and immigrant status and cervical cancer was found. Scarce information was found relating to sexuality, language, disability and geography and cervical cancer. Discussion: The \"cancer disparities grid\" facilitated a systematic and visual review of existing literature on social inequities and cervical cancer. The grid helped to elucidate uncontested existing social inequities, conflicting social inequities, and areas where social inequity data does not exist. The cancer disparities grid can be used as a research tool to help identify areas for future research, clinical programs, and political action related to cervical cancer and social inequities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Newmann","given":"Sara J."},{"family":"Garner","given":"Elizabeth O."}],"citation-key":"a33bc072-267b-3958-8d64-12037433fb48","container-title":"Cancer Causes & Control","ISSN":"09575243, 15737225","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005"]]},"page":"63–70","publisher":"Springer","title":"Social inequities along the cervical cancer continuum: A structured review","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20069441","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"abeAnaplasticThyroidCarcinoma2021","abstract":"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a type of thyroid carcinoma with the most aggressive biological behaviour amongst thyroid cancer. Here, we review the current genomic and the impacts of advances in therapies to improve the management of patients with the cancer.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Common mutations being identified in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma are p53 and TERT promoter mutations. Other common mutated genes included BRAF, RAS, EIF1AX, PIK3CA, PTEN and AKT1, SWI/SNF, ALK and CDKN2A. Changes in expression of different microRNAs are also involved in the pathogenesis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Curative resection combined with radiotherapy and combination chemotherapies (such as anthracyclines, platins and taxanes) has been shown to have effects in the treatment of some patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Newer molecular targeted therapies in clinical trials target mostly the cell membrane kinase and downstream proteins. These include targeting the EGFR, FGFR, VEGFR, c-kit, PDGFR and RET on the cell membrane as well as VEGF itself and the downstream targets such as BRAF, MEK and mTOR. Immunotherapy is also being tested in the cancer. Updated knowledge of genomic as well as clinical trials on novel therapies is needed to improve the management of the patients with this aggressive cancer.","author":[{"family":"Abe","given":"Ichiro"},{"family":"Lam","given":"Alfred King-Yin"}],"citation-key":"abeAnaplasticThyroidCarcinoma2021","container-title":"Current Oncology Reports","container-title-short":"Curr Oncol Rep","DOI":"10.1007/s11912-021-01019-9","ISSN":"1534-6269","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,13]]},"language":"eng","page":"31","PMID":"33582932","source":"PubMed","title":"Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma: Current Issues in Genomics and Therapeutics","title-short":"Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"abedi-ardekaniExtremelyHighTp532011","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Golestan Province in northeastern Iran has one of the highest incidences of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in the world with rates over 50 per 100,000 person-years in both sexes. We have analyzed TP53 mutation patterns in tumors from this high-risk geographic area in search of clues to the mutagenic processes involved in causing ESCC.\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Biopsies of 119 confirmed ESCC tumor tissue from subjects enrolled in a case-control study conducted in Golestan Province were analyzed by direct sequencing of TP53 exons 2 through 11. Immunohistochemical staining for p53 was carried out using two monoclonal antibodies, DO7 and 1801. A total of 120 TP53 mutations were detected in 107/119 cases (89.9%), including 11 patients with double or triple mutations. The mutation pattern was heterogeneous with infrequent mutations at common TP53 \"hotspots\" but frequent transversions potentially attributable to environmental carcinogens forming bulky DNA adducts, including 40% at bases known as site of mutagenesis by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Mutations showed different patterns according to the reported temperature of tea consumption, but no variation was observed in relation to ethnicity, tobacco or opium use, and alcoholic beverage consumption or urban versus rural residence.\nCONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: ESCC tumors in people from Golestan Province show the highest rate of TP53 mutations ever reported in any cancer anywhere. The heterogeneous mutation pattern is highly suggestive of a causative role for multiple environmental carcinogens, including PAHs. The temperature and composition of tea may also influence mutagenesis.","author":[{"family":"Abedi-Ardekani","given":"Behnoush"},{"family":"Kamangar","given":"Farin"},{"family":"Sotoudeh","given":"Masoud"},{"family":"Villar","given":"Stephanie"},{"family":"Islami","given":"Farhad"},{"family":"Aghcheli","given":"Karim"},{"family":"Nasrollahzadeh","given":"Dariush"},{"family":"Taghavi","given":"Noushin"},{"family":"Dawsey","given":"Sanford M."},{"family":"Abnet","given":"Christian C."},{"family":"Hewitt","given":"Stephen M."},{"family":"Fahimi","given":"Saman"},{"family":"Saidi","given":"Farrokh"},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Boffetta","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Malekzadeh","given":"Reza"},{"family":"Hainaut","given":"Pierre"}],"citation-key":"abedi-ardekaniExtremelyHighTp532011","container-title":"PloS One","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0029488","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"eng","page":"e29488","PMCID":"PMC3246475","PMID":"22216294","source":"PubMed","title":"Extremely high Tp53 mutation load in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in Golestan Province, Iran","type":"article-journal","volume":"6"},
  {"id":"acikgozRareSideEffect2021","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Immune checkpoint inhibitors are drugs that are included in the guidelines of hematological and solid cancer treatments, give highly effective results and increase T cell functionality. However, these drugs can cause immune-related adverse events resembling autoimmune diseases.\nCASE REPORT: A 50-year-old male patient was admitted to an external center with complaints of chest pain and dyspnea. Thoracic CT revealed a 97 × 58 mm mass in the left lung, and a diagnosis of Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) was made by biopsy. The PET/CT performed for staging was also evaluated as extensive stage small cell lung cancer. It was decided to give a combination of atezolizumab and carboplatin-etoposide to the patient.Management and outcome: The patient completed 3 cycles without any problem. Discordance was detected in the hemogram of the patient who came to the control for the assessment of response and had a regression in the imaging. Hemoglobin 9.6 g/dl (N: 14-17.5) hematocrit 14.8% (N: 41-51) were detected in the hemogram. Agglutinins were seen in the peripheral smear performed. Cold agglutinin (+4 positive) and indirect coombs (+3 positive) were found positive. Atezolizumab was stopped and methylprednisolone was started. After 10 days of treatment, discordance improved and methylprednisolone was discontinued by decreasing to half dose every 5 days.\nDISCUSSION: With the increasing use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, the variety of side effects has increased and case reports have increased. After detection of cold agglutinin, IgG, cryoglobulin, mycoplasma pneumonia, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV were found negative in the differential diagnosis, Our case appears to be immune checkpoint inhibitor-related Cold Agglutinin Disease (CAD). It should not be forgotten that immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are widely used, may cause CAD, and hemoglobin-hematocrit discordance should be paid attention to in routine controls.","author":[{"family":"Acikgoz","given":"Ozgur"},{"family":"Bayramgil","given":"Ayberk"},{"family":"Cavusoglu","given":"Gunes"},{"family":"Sadri","given":"Sevil"}],"citation-key":"acikgozRareSideEffect2021","container-title":"Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice: Official Publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners","container-title-short":"J Oncol Pharm Pract","DOI":"10.1177/10781552211033009","ISSN":"1477-092X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"2066-2068","PMID":"34282980","source":"PubMed","title":"Rare side effect caused by atezolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor: Cold agglutinin disease","title-short":"Rare side effect caused by atezolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

The evolution in science and technology has promoted deeper knowledge in the genetic pathways and mechanisms driving advance thyroid cancer. Furthermore, understanding molecular pathways resulted in the application of antineoplastic agents used in other tumors to thyroid cancer and the development of new highly selective drugs. A major landmark in anaplastic thyroid cancer management history was recently reached with the approval of BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination, specifically dabrafenib and trametinib for BRAF-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer; this treatment has improved survival and outcomes in this population.

  {"id":"ahmedPrimaryMediastinalBCell2021","abstract":"Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is an aggressive B-cell lymphoma arising from thymic B-cells having clinicopathologic features distinct from systemic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). PMBCL comprises 2% to 4% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), 7% of DLBCL and seen predominantly in young females with a median age of 35 years at diagnosis. The annual incidence of PMBCL is 0.4 per million with a 5-year survival rate exceeding 70% with improving supportive care and genetic characterization of the disease. Pathogenesis involves dysregulation of Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT), nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) pathways and amplification of the 9p24.1 region of chromosome 9. PMBCL patients have a prolonged life expectancy necessitating the need for treatment approaches that are based on maximizing cure with minimal long-term toxicity. Due to rarity and its recognition as a distinct entity, therapeutic decisions are guided by clinical presentation, clinician and center experience, and analysis of patients with PMBCL within DLBCL registries. Historically R-CHOP has been the usual first line treatment for PMBCL followed by involved site radiotherapy (ISRT), however clinical practice varies across centers with emerging consensus to avoid upfront RT by utilizing dose intense regimens (DA-EPOCH-R) in younger and fit patients. Prognosis of relapsed refractory PMBCL not responding to salvage chemotherapy is dismal, however there are many emerging options including Brentuximab Vedotin, immune check point inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. In this article, we focus on the pathogenesis, current and evolving treatments, and provide recommendations for optimal management of patients with PMBCL.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Zahoor"},{"family":"Afridi","given":"Safa Saadat"},{"family":"Shahid","given":"Zeryab"},{"family":"Zamani","given":"Zarlakhta"},{"family":"Rehman","given":"Sana"},{"family":"Aiman","given":"Wajeeha"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Mir","given":"Muhammad Ayaz"},{"family":"Awan","given":"Farrukh T."},{"family":"Anwer","given":"Faiz"},{"family":"Iftikhar","given":"Raheel"}],"citation-key":"ahmedPrimaryMediastinalBCell2021","container-title":"Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia","container-title-short":"Clinical Lymphoma Myeloma and Leukemia","DOI":"10.1016/j.clml.2021.06.012","ISSN":"2152-2650","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"e865-e875","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Primary Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma: A 2021 Update on Genetics, Diagnosis, and Novel Therapeutics","title-short":"Primary Mediastinal B-Cell Lymphoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2152265021002421","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"ahnImmuneProfilingAdvanced2021","abstract":"Background: Advanced thyroid cancers, including differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) with distant metastasis, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), are associated with poor clinical outcomes and limited treatment options. This study aimed to determine the immune profiles of advanced thyroid cancers using fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry (F-MIHC) and multispectral imaging (MSI). Methods: Twenty-eight tissue samples were collected from 12 patients who had DTC with distant metastasis and from 16 with ATC. The samples were assessed using F-MIHC and MSI with antibodies against the cell surface molecules, cluster of differentiation (CD)4, CD8, programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), PD ligand 1 (PD-L1), forkhead box protein 3, and cytokeratin (CK). The expression of PD-L1 was evaluated using tumor proportion score (TPS) and combined positive score (CPS). Results: Significantly, more PD-L1-positive tumor cells (CK+PD-L1+) per mm2 were found in ATC samples than in DTC samples (183.5 vs. 0.03, p < 0.001). Lymphocyte infiltration was significantly increased in ATC compared with DTC, with significantly more PD-L1- or PD-1-positive lymphocytes in ATC samples than in DTC samples. The TPS and CPS for PD-L1 expression were negative in all DTC samples but positive in 81% and 94% of ATC samples, respectively. Conclusions: Immune profiling revealed significant differences between advanced DTC and ATC, particularly in terms of PD-L1 expression and lymphocyte infiltration. Therefore, immune profiling using F-MIHC and MSI can provide invaluable information regarding tumor microenvironments, which could help select candidates for immunotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Ahn","given":"Jonghwa"},{"family":"Jin","given":"Meihua"},{"family":"Song","given":"Eyun"},{"family":"Ryu","given":"Yeon-Mi"},{"family":"Song","given":"Dong Eun"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sang-Yeob"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Tae Yong"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Won Bae"},{"family":"Shong","given":"Young Kee"},{"family":"Jeon","given":"Min Ji"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Won Gu"}],"citation-key":"ahnImmuneProfilingAdvanced2021","container-title":"Thyroid: Official Journal of the American Thyroid Association","container-title-short":"Thyroid","DOI":"10.1089/thy.2020.0312","ISSN":"1557-9077","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"61-67","PMID":"32611231","source":"PubMed","title":"Immune Profiling of Advanced Thyroid Cancers Using Fluorescent Multiplex Immunohistochemistry","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},
  {"id":"ajaniTreatmentPatientsUpper1997","abstract":"Carcinomas of the stomach and esophagus are a major health problem worldwide. Cancer remains incurable when it is metastatic or unresectable, and new active agents are needed to improve the outcome for these patients. Three phase II studies of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) are described here. The first, at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, examined the role of single-agent paclitaxel in untreated patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. Thirty-three patients were accrued. The starting dose of paclitaxel was 200 mg/m2 and it was repeated every 21 days. The first 15 patients received paclitaxel administered over 3 hours, and the subsequent 18 patients received paclitaxel administered over 24 hours. Three patients were not evaluable. Among the first 15 patients (two not evaluable) receiving paclitaxel over 3 hours, there was one partial response (PR) (8%) and three minor responses (MRs) (23%). Among the 18 patients (one not evaluable) receiving paclitaxel over 24 hours, however, there were four PRs (24%) and three MRs (18%). The overall PR rate was 17% (five of 30 patients). The median duration of PR was 6.5 months (range, 2.3 to 11.3+ months). Myelosuppression was more severe with the 24-hour schedule than with the 3-hour schedule. Our data suggest that paclitaxel is active against gastric carcinoma, albeit to a lesser degree than in esophageal adenocarcinoma. Paclitaxel should be investigated further in combination therapy with other active agents. In the second phase II study, paclitaxel was administered via a 24-hour intravenous infusion in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable locoregional or metastatic carcinoma of the esophagus. The starting dose of paclitaxel was 250 mg/m2, repeated every 21 days. In addition, patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 microg/kg/d subcutaneously) 24 hours after the completion of treatment. Thirty-three patients had adenocarcinoma and 18 had squamous cell carcinoma. Sixteen patients (31%) achieved a response (one complete response [CR] and 15 PRs), and 11 (22%) achieved an MR. Of the 33 patients with adenocarcinoma, 12 (36%) achieved either a CR (one patient) or a PR (11 patients); six patients had an MR. Four of 18 patients (22%) with squamous cell carcinoma had a PR and four (22%) had an MR. Paclitaxel was well tolerated. Granulocytopenia was frequent, resulting in 11 hospitalizations in nine patients. Thus, paclitaxel is active against both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. In a subsequent phase II trial, paclitaxel has been studied in combination with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil in 30 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma and 22 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. The doses are paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered over 3 hours on day 1, cisplatin 20 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5, and S-fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/d (in the first 10 patients, but then reduced to 750 mg/m2/d as continuous infusion on days 1 to 5) given every 28 days. Among the 47 patients evaluated for response so far, four have had a CR and 17 have had a PR (overall response rate, 45%). Toxicity with this combination has been moderate, and there have been no treatment-related deaths. With the reduced starting dose of 5-fluorouracil, the tolerance of this combination has improved substantially both in the inpatient and outpatient settings, resulting in a low frequency of grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicity. Response has been higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.","author":[{"family":"Ajani","given":"J.

  {"id":"akiyamaPrinciplesSurgicalTreatment1981a","abstract":"Extensive lymph node dissections in the posterior mediastinum and abdomen were performed during resections of esophageal carcinomas. Analysis of lymph nodes demonstrated a widespread distribution of positive lymph nodes regardless of the location of the tumor. The distribution of positive lymph nodes was noticed in the area between the superior mediastinum and the celiac region. The studies were also made on the distribution of positive lymph nodes in the superior gastric region, particularly in the region of the lesser curvature of the stomach. The following principles should be followed when carcinoma of the esophagus is surgically treated. 1) Lymph node dissection of the whole length of the posterior mediastinum, superior gastric region, and celiac region must be performed. 2) Total thoracic and abdominal esophagectomy with resection of the proximal lesser curvature and cardia, including the first to fourth branches, and preferably the fifth branch of the left gastric artery, is mandatory in order to remove possible lymphatic and intramural spread of tumors. 3) Satisfactory esophageal replacement in one stage must follow.

The operative mortality rate was 1.4% and the overall five-year survival rate was 34.6%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Akiyama","given":"H"},{"family":"Tsurumaru","given":"M"},{"family":"Kawamura","given":"T"},{"family":"Ono","given":"Y"}],"citation-key":"akiyamaPrinciplesSurgicalTreatment1981a","container-title":"Annals of Surgery","container-title-short":"Ann Surg","ISSN":"0003-4932","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1981",10]]},"page":"438-446","PMCID":"PMC1345319","PMID":"7283505","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Principles of surgical treatment for carcinoma of the esophagus: analysis of lymph node involvement.","title-short":"Principles of surgical treatment for carcinoma of the esophagus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1345319/","volume":"194"},

However, it is only recently that cancer of the esophagus has been evaluated in terms of analyzing lymphatic spread and results of lymphadenectomy.\nMETHODS: Among 1298 patients admitted to the Toranomon Hospital between 1973 and 1993, 913 (70.3%) had resections, including curative and palliative procedures. For this study, 717 patients with TNM RO (resection with no residual tumor at operation in TNM classification) were analyzed. Survival was compared between groups of patients with less extensive thoracoabdominal (two-field) dissections and extensive collothoracoabdominal (three-field) dissections.\nRESULTS: Comparative study revealed that 5-year survival rate for TNM RO patients after free-field dissection (55.0%) was significantly better (log rank test, p = 0.0013) than the rate after two-field dissection (38.3%). The results were particularly significant in subgroups with stage III and IV (because of nodal factor). Overall 5-year survival rate after all resections was 42.4%.\nCONCLUSIONS: The role of radical lymph node dissection in cancer of the thoracic esophagus evaluated. Long-term survival was compared between two groups with two- and three-field dissection. It was concluded that survival rate was significantly better in patients with extensive three-field dissection.","author":[{"family":"Akiyama","given":"H."},{"family":"Tsurumaru","given":"M."},{"family":"Udagawa","given":"H."},{"family":"Kajiyama","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"akiyamaRadicalLymphNode1994","container-title":"Annals of Surgery","container-title-short":"Ann Surg","DOI":"10.1097/00000658-199409000-00012","ISSN":"0003-4932","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"364-372; discussion 372-373","PMCID":"PMC1234394","PMID":"8092902","source":"PubMed","title":"Radical lymph node dissection for cancer of the thoracic esophagus","type":"article-journal","volume":"220"},

To investigate its cytoreductive potential, Nd:YAG laser tumor debulking was added to multimodality therapy. <b>Methods:</b> From 1994-1998, 29 patients with advanced locoregional esophageal carcinoma were enrolled in a prospective experimental study of high-dose neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy together with endoscopic Nd:YAG laser photoablation. Comparisons were made to a retrospective cohort of 31 patients treated from 1990 to 1994 who underwent similar neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy without laser debulking. <b>Results:</b> Laser dosage ranged from 3457 to 67,443 J (mean 21,832 [SD 16,999]) delivered in 1 to 6 (mean 2.6 [1.4]) treatment sessions. Actuarial analysis showed improved survival in the laser-treated group versus the reference group (30.1 months vs. 16.5 months; <i>p</i> = 0.047). Multivariable analysis of the impact of age, T-stage, N-stage, completion of neoadjuvant therapy, and laser debulking that included all patients in both treatment groups showed completion of therapy to be the most significant variable associated with survival. There were 3 complications related to laser therapy. Relief of dysphagia was achieved in 19 of 29 patients (66%) in the laser group versus 13 of 31 (42%) in the reference group. <b>Conclusions:</b> Malignant dysphagia may be more effectively treated by the addition of Nd:YAG laser therapy to aggressive multimodality therapy.

Random assignment was to surgery alone (S) or to two cycles of combination cisplatin and fluorouracil before surgery (CS). Initial results reported in 2002 demonstrated an advantage for both disease-free and overall survival in the CS group. The analysis has now been updated after a median follow-up of 6 years.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: OEO2 recruited 802 patients, 400 on CS and 402 on S. The nature of the first recurrence event and cause of death are detailed. Survival has been determined from Kaplan-Meier curves and treatment comparisons made with the log-rank test. Survival by extent of resection is presented.\nRESULTS: There were 655 deaths, 335 for S and 320 for CS. The survival benefit has been maintained with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.98; P = .03) which in absolute terms is a 5-year survival of 23.0% for CS compared with 17.1% for S. The treatment effect is consistent in both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The first disease-free survival event was macroscopic residual disease from incomplete resection (R2) or no resection in 26.4% of the S group versus 14.3% of the CS P < .001. Three-year survival by type of resection was R0 42.4%, R1 was 18.0%, and R2 was 8.6%.\nCONCLUSION: Long-term follow-up confirms that preoperative chemotherapy improves survival in operable esophageal cancer and should be considered as a standard of care.","author":[{"family":"Allum","given":"William H."},{"family":"Stenning","given":"Sally P."},{"family":"Bancewicz","given":"John"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Peter I."},{"family":"Langley","given":"Ruth E."}],"citation-key":"allumLongtermResultsRandomized2009","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2009.22.2083","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"30","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",10,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"5062-5067","PMID":"19770374","source":"PubMed","title":"Long-term results of a randomized trial of surgery with or without preoperative chemotherapy in esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"27"},

However, there is scant literature reporting their epidemiology, particularly whether the diagnosis of PPGL has increased with advances in medical imaging and biochemical and genetic testing.\nObjective: The primary objective of this systematic review was to determine the annual incidence of PPGLs and change over time.\nDesign: A systematic review was performed. Medline, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched to identify studies reporting PPGL incidence. Studies were eligible for inclusion from the database's inception until August 30, 2021.\nResults: A total of 6109 manuscripts were identified; 2282 duplicates were excluded, and a further 3815 papers were excluded after abstract and/or full text review. Twelve studies were included in the final review. The incidence of PPGL ranged from 0.04 to 0.95 cases per 100 000 per year. Incidence increased over time, from approximately 0.2/100,000 individuals in studies performed before 2000, to approximately 0.6/100,000 in studies undertaken after 2010. The mode of diagnosis changed over the same time period, with more patients diagnosed from incidental imaging findings, and fewer at autopsy or from symptoms.\nConclusion: The annual incidence of PPGL has increased over time. Much of this increase is likely from incidental identification of tumors on imaging. However, the epidemiology of PPGL remains understudied, in particular, in associations with altitude, ethnicity, and genetics. To improve early detection and management guidelines, these gaps should be addressed.","author":[{"family":"Al Subhi","given":"Abdul Rahman"},{"family":"Boyle","given":"Veronica"},{"family":"Elston","given":"Marianne S."}],"citation-key":"alsubhiSystematicReviewIncidence2022","container-title":"Journal of the Endocrine Society","container-title-short":"J Endocr Soc","DOI":"10.1210/jendso/bvac105","ISSN":"2472-1972","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"bvac105","PMCID":"PMC9334688","PMID":"35919261","source":"PubMed","title":"Systematic Review: Incidence of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Over 70 Years","title-short":"Systematic Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1210%2Fjendso%2Fbvac105","volume":"6"},

For this reason, neoadjuvant cytoreductive treatments are more and more frequently used with the aim of downstaging the tumor, increasing the resection rate, and possibly improving survival.\n          Methods \n          From January 1983 to December 1991, 163 consecutive patients with a presumedly T4 squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus (group A) received on average 2.5 cycles (range, 1-6) of first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day, in continuous infusion from day 1 through day 5). Chemotherapy was followed by surgery when adequate downstaging of the tumor was obtained.\n          Results \n          Chemotherapy toxicity was WHO grade 0 to 2 in 80% of cases, but 3 toxic deaths (1.9%) occurred. Restaging suggested a downstaging of the tumor in 101 of 163 patients (62%), but only 85 patients (52%) underwent resection surgery; it was complete or R0 in 52 (32%) and incomplete or R1-2 in 33. Overall postoperative mortality was 11.7% (10 of 85), morbidity 41% (35 of 85). Complete pathologic response was documented in 6 patients, and significant downstaging to pStage I, IIA, or IIB occurred in 25 more patients. The overall 5-year survival was 11% (median, 11 months). After resection surgery, the 5-year survival was 20% (median, 16 months); none of the nonresponders survived 4 years after palliative treatments without resection (median survival, 5 months). The 5-year survival rate of the 52 patients undergoing an R0 resection was 29% (median, 23 months). Stratifying patients according to the R, pT, pN, and pStage classifications, the survival curves were comparable to the corresponding data obtained in the 587 group B patients with \"potentially resectable\" esophageal cancer who underwent surgery alone during the same period. Furthermore, the results were improved in comparison with 136 previous or subsequent patients with a locally advanced tumor who did not undergo neoadjuvant treatments (group C). In these patients, the R0 resection rate was 7%, and the overall 5-year survival was 3% (median, 5 months).\n          Conclusion \n          Although nonrandomized, these results suggest that in locally advanced esophageal carcinoma, first-line chemotherapy increases the resection rate and improves the overall long-term survival. In responding patients who undergo R0 resection surgery, the prognosis depends on the final pathologic stage and not on the initial pretreatment stage.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ancona","given":"Ermanno"},{"family":"Ruol","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Castoro","given":"Carlo"},{"family":"Chiarion-Sileni","given":"Vanna"},{"family":"Merigliano","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Santi","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Bonavina","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Peracchia","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"anconaFirstLineChemotherapyImproves1997","container-title":"Annals of Surgery","ISSN":"0003-4932","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",12]]},"language":"en-US","page":"714","source":"journals-lww-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu","title":"First-Line Chemotherapy Improves the Resection Rate and Long-Term Survival of Locally Advanced (T4, any N, M0) Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Thoracic Esophagus: Final Report on 163 Consecutive Patients With 5-Year Follow-Up","title-short":"First-Line Chemotherapy Improves the Resection Rate and Long-Term Survival of Locally Advanced (T4, any N, M0) Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Thoracic Esophagus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/fulltext/1997/12000/first_line_chemotherapy_improves_the_resection.8.aspx","volume":"226"},

Some randomized trials of preoperative chemotherapy suggest that the prognosis of patients who respond may be improved.\nMETHODS: This randomized, controlled trial compared patients with clinically resectable esophageal epidermoid carcinoma who underwent surgery alone (Arm A) with those who received preoperative chemotherapy (Arm B). Overall survival and the prognostic impact of major response to chemotherapy were analyzed. Forty-eight patients were enrolled in each arm. Chemotherapy consisted of two or three cycles of cisplatin (100 mg/m2 on Day 1) and 5- fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2 per day continuous infusion on Days 1-5). In both study arms, transthoracic esophagectomy plus two-field lymphadenectomy was performed.

  {"id":"aokiPrognosticSignificancePleural2014","abstract":"The prognosis of patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma has improved over recent years. However, the optimal treatment strategy including the role of radiotherapy remains unknown. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical outcomes of 345 patients with newly diagnosed primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma in Japan. With a median follow up of 48 months, the overall survival at four years for patients treated with R-CHOP (n=187), CHOP (n=44), DA-EPOCH-R (n=9), 2(nd)- or 3(rd)-generation regimens, and chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation were 90%, 67%, 100%, 91% and 92%, respectively. Focusing on patients treated with R-CHOP, a higher International Prognostic Index score and the presence of pleural or pericardial effusion were identified as adverse prognostic factors for overall survival in patients treated with R-CHOP without consolidative radiotherapy (IPI: hazard ratio 4.23, 95% confidence interval 1.48-12.13, P=0.007; effusion: hazard ratio 4.93, 95% confidence interval 1.37-17.69, P=0.015). Combined with the International Prognostic Index score and the presence of pleural or pericardial effusion for the stratification of patients treated with R-CHOP without radiotherapy, patients with lower International Prognostic Index score and the absence of effusion comprised approximately one-half of these patients and could be identified as curable patients (95% overall survival at 4 years). The DA-EPOCH-R regimen might overcome the effect of these adverse prognostic factors. Our simple indicators of International Prognostic Index score and the presence of pleural or pericardial effusion could stratify patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and help guide selection of treatment.","author":[{"family":"Aoki","given":"Tomohiro"},{"family":"Izutsu","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Ritsuro"},{"family":"Nakaseko","given":"Chiaki"},{"family":"Arima","given":"Hiroshi"},{"family":"Shimada","given":"Kazuyuki"},{"family":"Tomita","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Sasaki","given":"Makoto"},{"family":"Takizawa","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Mitani","given":"Kinuko"},{"family":"Igarashi","given":"Tadahiko"},{"family":"Maeda","given":"Yoshinobu"},{"family":"Fukuhara","given":"Noriko"},{"family":"Ishida","given":"Fumihiro"},{"family":"Niitsu","given":"Nozomi"},{"family":"Ohmachi","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Takasaki","given":"Hirotaka"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Naoya"},{"family":"Kinoshita","given":"Tomohiro"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Shigeo"},{"family":"Ogura","given":"Michinori"}],"citation-key":"aokiPrognosticSignificancePleural2014","container-title":"Haematologica","container-title-short":"Haematologica","DOI":"10.3324/haematol.2014.111203","ISSN":"1592-8721","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"1817-1825","PMCID":"PMC4258760","PMID":"25216682","source":"PubMed","title":"Prognostic significance of pleural or pericardial effusion and the implication of optimal treatment in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma: a multicenter retrospective study in Japan","title-short":"Prognostic significance of pleural or pericardial effusion and the implication of optimal treatment in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"99"},

  {"id":"arnoldGlobalBurdenOesophageal2020","abstract":"Objectives To provide updated estimates of the global burden of oesophageal and gastric cancer by subsite and type.\nMethods Using data from population-based cancer registries, proportions of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) and squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) out of all oesophageal as well as cardia gastric cancer (CGC) and non-CGC (NCGC) out of all gastric cancer cases were computed by country, sex and age group. Proportions were subsequently applied to the estimated numbers of oesophageal and gastric cancer cases from GLOBOCAN 2018. Age-standardised incidence rates (ASR) were calculated.\nResults In 2018, there were an estimated 572 000 new cases of oesophageal cancer worldwide, 85 000 OACs (ASR 0.9 per 100 000, both sexes combined) and 482 000 OSCCs (ASR 5.3). Out of 1.03 million gastric cancers, there were an estimated 181 000 cases of CGC (ASR 2.0) and 853 000 cases of NCGC (ASR 9.2). While the highest incidence rates of OSCC, CGC and NCGC were observed in Eastern Asia (ASRs 11.1, 4.4 and 17.9, respectively), rates of OAC were highest in Northern Europe (ASR 3.5). While globally OSCC and NCGC remain the most common types of oesophageal and gastric cancer, respectively, rates of OAC exceed those of OSCC in an increasing number of high-income countries.\nConclusions These updated estimates of the global burden of oesophageal and gastric cancer by subtype and site suggest an ongoing transition in epidemiological patterns. This work will serve as a cornerstone for policy-making and will aid in developing appropriate cancer control strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Arnold","given":"Melina"},{"family":"Ferlay","given":"Jacques"},{"family":"Henegouwen","given":"Mark I. van Berge"},{"family":"Soerjomataram","given":"Isabelle"}],"citation-key":"arnoldGlobalBurdenOesophageal2020","container-title":"Gut","DOI":"10.1136/gutjnl-2020-321600","ISSN":"0017-5749, 1468-3288","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"en","license":"© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

  {"id":"atiqPembrolizumabInducedColdAgglutinin2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND The introduction of immunotherapy in the management of metastatic lung cancer appears to be changing their natural history. Most patients tolerate immunotherapy without any significant adverse events. Nevertheless, a significant number of patients still experience adverse effects. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been described as mostly related to warm autoantibodies. The following case report describes cold agglutinin disease with hemolysis secondary to Pembrolizumab therapy for the treatment of metastatic lung cancer. CASE REPORT A 58-year-old woman noted a left neck mass 4 months prior to her presentation. A biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic adenocarcinoma, consistent with primary lung cancer. Further evaluation revealed the tumor to be PDL-1-positive. She was started on Pembrolizumab, Pemetrexed, and carboplatin chemotherapy regimen. Her CBC was within normal limits when she started therapy, but within 4 weeks hemoglobin dropped to 4.3 g/dL. Further evaluation showed high cryoglobulin levels and a high cold agglutinin titer. Complement C3 DAT was positive. A peripheral smear showed clumps of red cells and the serum IgM was elevated. The diagnosis of CAD was made. She was then started on Rituximab. Imaging showed a significant response, with decreased disease burden. CONCLUSIONS Our case shows a unique presentation of CAD, initially presumed to be myelosuppression secondary to chemotherapy. Instead, a peripheral smear revealed Pembrolizumab to be the cause of cold agglutinin disease. Due to the relatively unknown association between these 2 entities, patient care was delayed. Finally, after initiation of Rituximab therapy, the patient's CBC began to recover.","author":[{"family":"Atiq","given":"Osman"},{"family":"Atiq","given":"Saad O."},{"family":"Atiq","given":"Zainab O."},{"family":"Patel","given":"Vijay"},{"family":"Atiq","given":"Mohammad O."},{"family":"Atiq","given":"Omar T."}],"citation-key":"atiqPembrolizumabInducedColdAgglutinin2020","container-title":"The American Journal of Case Reports","container-title-short":"Am J Case Rep","DOI":"10.12659/AJCR.924283","ISSN":"1941-5923","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,5]]},"language":"eng","page":"e924283","PMCID":"PMC7491957","PMID":"32887867","source":"PubMed","title":"Pembrolizumab-Induced Cold Agglutinin Disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},

Of 55 eligible patients, 42 (76.3%) agreed to randomization with either chemotherapy followed by surgery (n = 21) or surgery alone (n = 21). The other 13 refused. The chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. All 55 patients underwent esophagectomy with two- or three-field resection, including two (3.6%) hospital mortalities. Of the 21 patients receiving chemotherapy, the response rate was 33.3% after the first course and 60% after the second course. A complete response was not obtained. Responders to the first course showed a prolonged survival, however time to treatment failure did not differ between patients treated with chemotherapy followed by surgery or surgery alone. This chemotherapy offered a worse surgical outcome for patients with pretreatment diagnosis of T3. Multivariate analysis identified a partial response to the first course of chemotherapy to be a favorable prognostic indicator. Preoperative chemotherapy does not give a survival benefit over surgery alone for patients with advanced tumor (T3).

Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), we investigated the genetic alterations of 224 cases of untreated DLBCL (87 GCB-DLBCL, 77 ABC-DLBCL, 19 PMBCL, and 41 unclassified DLBCL) previously characterized by gene-expression profiling. The DLBCL subgroups differed significantly in the frequency of particular chromosomal aberrations. ABC-DLBCL had frequent trisomy 3, gains of 3q and 18q21-q22, and losses of 6q21-q22, whereas GCB-DLBCL had frequent gains of 12q12, and PMBCL had gains of 9p21-pter and 2p14-p16. Parallel analysis of CGH alterations, locus-specific gene-expression profiles, and global gene-expression signatures revealed that DNA amplifications and gains had a substantial impact on the expression of genes in the involved chromosomal regions, and some genes were overexpressed in a DLBCL subgroup-specific fashion. Unexpectedly, specific chromosomal alterations were associated with significant changes in gene-expression signatures that reflect various aspects of lymphoma cell biology as well as the host response to the lymphoma. In addition, gains involving the chromosomal region 3p11-p12 provided prognostic information that was statistically independent of the previously defined gene-expression-based survival model, thereby improving its predictive power.","author":[{"family":"Bea","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Zettl","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Wright","given":"George"},{"family":"Salaverria","given":"Itziar"},{"family":"Jehn","given":"Philipp"},{"family":"Moreno","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Burek","given":"Christof"},{"family":"Ott","given":"German"},{"family":"Puig","given":"Xavier"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Liming"},{"family":"Lopez-Guillermo","given":"Armando"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Wing C."},{"family":"Greiner","given":"Timothy C."},{"family":"Weisenburger","given":"Dennis D."},{"family":"Armitage","given":"James O."},{"family":"Gascoyne","given":"Randy D."},{"family":"Connors","given":"Joseph M."},{"family":"Grogan","given":"Thomas M."},{"family":"Braziel","given":"Rita"},{"family":"Fisher","given":"Richard I."},{"family":"Smeland","given":"Erlend B."},{"family":"Kvaloy","given":"Stein"},{"family":"Holte","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Delabie","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Powell","given":"John"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Wyndham H."},{"family":"Jaffe","given":"Elaine S."},{"family":"Montserrat","given":"Emili"},{"family":"Muller-Hermelink","given":"Hans-Konrad"},{"family":"Staudt","given":"Louis M."},{"family":"Campo","given":"Elias"},{"family":"Rosenwald","given":"Andreas"},{"literal":"Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project"}],"citation-key":"beaDiffuseLargeBcell2005","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2005-04-1399","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",11,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"3183-3190","PMCID":"PMC1895326","PMID":"16046532","source":"PubMed","title":"Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subgroups have distinct genetic profiles that influence tumor biology and improve gene-expression-based survival prediction","type":"article-journal","volume":"106"},

While corticosteroids remain first-line therapy in most cases of warm-antibody AIHA, cold agglutinin disease is treated by targeting the underlying clonal B-cell proliferation or the classical complement activation pathway. Several new established or investigational drugs and treatment regimens have appeared during the last 1-2 decades, resulting in an improvement of therapy options but also raising challenges on how to select the best treatment in individual patients. In severe warm-antibody AIHA, there is evidence for the upfront addition of rituximab to prednisolone in the first line. Novel agents targeting B-cells, extravascular hemolysis, or removing IgG will offer further options in the acute and relapsed/refractory settings. In cold agglutinin disease, the development of complement inhibitors and B-cell targeting agents makes it possible to individualize therapy, based on the disease profile and patient characteristics. For most AIHAs, the optimal treatment remains to be found, and there is still a need for more evidence-based therapies.

In Norway and a northern region of Italy, the study was close to being population-based. For the first time, we demonstrate fourfold differences between cold and warmer climates regarding prevalence (20 vs 5 cases/million) and incidence (1.9 vs 0.48 cases/million per year). Mean baseline hemoglobin level was 9.3 g/dL, but 27% had hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL. Identification of typical features of CAD-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in the bone marrow was greatly increased by centralized biopsy assessment. CAD seems to be associated with a slightly increased risk of venous thrombosis. This work includes a follow-up study of therapies, focusing on the long-term outcomes of the rituximab plus bendamustine and rituximab plus fludarabine regimens. Rituximab plus bendamustine therapy resulted in responses in 35 (78%) of 45 patients; 24 (53%) achieved complete response. Interestingly, these rates were still higher than observed in the original (2017) prospective trial, and we also found a shift toward deeper responses with time. This is explained by the prolonged time to response seen in many patients, probably related to long-lived plasma cells. In patients responding to rituximab-bendamustine, median response duration was not reached after 88 months, and estimated 5-year sustained remission was 77%. The regimen appeared safe regarding late-occurring malignancies. Rituximab plus fludarabine therapy seems to carry a higher risk of long-term adverse effects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Berentsen","given":"Sigbjørn"},{"family":"Barcellini","given":"Wilma"},{"family":"D’Sa","given":"Shirley"},{"family":"Randen","given":"Ulla"},{"family":"Tvedt","given":"Tor Henrik Anderson"},{"family":"Fattizzo","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Haukås","given":"Einar"},{"family":"Kell","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Brudevold","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Dahm","given":"Anders E.

  {"id":"berentsenHowTreatCold2021","abstract":"The last decades have seen great progress in the treatment of cold agglutinin disease (CAD). Comparative trials are lacking, and recommendations must be based mainly on nonrandomized trials and will be influenced by personal experience. Herein, current treatment options are reviewed and linked to 3 cases, each addressing specific aspects of therapy. Two major steps in CAD pathogenesis are identified, clonal B-cell lymphoproliferation and complement-mediated hemolysis, each of which constitutes a target of therapy. Although drug treatment is not always indicated, patients with symptomatic anemia or other bothersome symptoms should be treated. The importance of avoiding ineffective therapies is underscored. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat CAD. Studies on safety and efficacy of relevant drugs and combinations are briefly described. The author recommends that B cell–directed approaches remain the first choice in most patients requiring treatment. The 4-cycle bendamustine plus rituximab combination is highly efficacious and sufficiently safe and induces durable responses in most patients, but the time to response can be many months. Rituximab monotherapy should be preferred in frail patients. The complement C1s inhibitor sutimlimab is an emerging option in the second line and may also find its place in the first line in specific situations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Berentsen","given":"Sigbjørn"}],"citation-key":"berentsenHowTreatCold2021","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood.2019003809","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",3,11]]},"page":"1295-1303","source":"Silverchair","title":"How I treat cold agglutinin disease","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019003809","volume":"137"},
  {"id":"berentsenNewInsightsPathogenesis2020","abstract":"Autoimmune hemolytic anemias mediated by cold agglutinins can be divided into cold agglutinin disease (CAD), which is a well-defined clinicopathologic entity and a clonal lymphoproliferative disorder, and secondary cold agglutinin syndrome (CAS), in which a similar picture of cold-hemolytic anemia occurs secondary to another distinct clinical disease. Thus, the pathogenesis in CAD is quite different from that of polyclonal autoimmune diseases such as warm-antibody AIHA. In both CAD and CAS, hemolysis is mediated by the classical complement pathway and therefore can result in generation of anaphylotoxins, such as complement split product 3a (C3a) and, to some extent, C5a. On the other hand, infection and inflammation can act as triggers and drivers of hemolysis, exemplified by exacerbation of CAD in situations with acute phase reaction and the role of specific infections (particularly Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Epstein-Barr virus) as causes of CAS. In this review, the putative mechanisms behind these phenomena will be explained along with other recent achievements in the understanding of pathogenesis in these disorders. Therapeutic approaches have been directed against the clonal lymphoproliferation in CAD or the underlying disease in CAS. Currently, novel targeted treatments, in particular complement-directed therapies, are also being rapidly developed and will be reviewed.","author":[{"family":"Berentsen","given":"Sigbjørn"}],"citation-key":"berentsenNewInsightsPathogenesis2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","container-title-short":"Front Immunol","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2020.00590","ISSN":"1664-3224","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","page":"590","PMCID":"PMC7154122","PMID":"32318071","source":"PubMed","title":"New Insights in the Pathogenesis and Therapy of Cold Agglutinin-Mediated Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},

The aim of this study was to collect comprehensive and precise data the on epidemiology, clinical and pathological features, course, and therapy of CAD.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a population-based retrospective follow-up study of as many as possible of all CAD patients in Norway. Eighty-six patients were studied.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of primary CAD was 16 cases per million inhabitants. The incidence rate was 1 per million per year. The median age at onset was 67 years (range, 30-92) and the male to female ratio was 0.55. The median survival was 12.5 years from onset. Autoimmune diseases other than CAD were reported in 8% of patients, cold-induced circulatory symptoms in 91%, and exacerbation of hemolytic anemia during febrile illness in 74%. At least 51% had received red blood cell transfusions. The mean initial hemoglobin level was 9.2 g/dL (range, 4.5-15.6) and the median monoclonal immunoglobulin level 4.0 g/L (range, 0.0-47.3). Most laboratory findings did not change significantly during a median follow-up of 5 years. Monoclonal IgM was detected in 90%; IgG and IgA in 3.5% each; with kappa light chains in 94%. An abnormal kappa/lambda ratio in bone marrow was found in 90%, lymphoma in 76%, and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in 50%. Transformation to aggressive lymphoma occurred in 3.5% during 10 years. Rituximab therapy was the only treatment showing acceptable response rates (60%).\nINTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Primary CAD represents a spectrum of clonal lymphoproliferative bone marrow disorders, in most cases with morphological signs of lymphoma.

A meta-analysis of all published randomized clinical trials and historical control studies which have used cisplatinum-based combination CT was carried out to asses the effect of chemotherapy on survival for esophageal cancer.\nMaterials and methods\nA computer-based literature search was performed for the period from January 1988 to March 1995 using the index terms ‘Esophageal neoplasms’ and ‘Chemotherapy’. The frame of reference was further narrowed to include only cisplatinum-based combination chemotherapy. Twelve randomized clinical trials (RCT) and eight historical control (HC) studies were included in the meta-analysis.\nResults\nIn the overview of HC studies a highly significant reduction in odds of death with CT was observed (68% ± 8% OR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.24–0.42).

The analysis was carried out using the Cox model for known prognostic factors without any correction for historical bias. Database was reanalysed after introducing registration year as a variable in the model to correct for historical control bias, which was further examined by carrying out a case-control study comparing chemotherapy (n = 83) vs contemporary control (n = 164) matched for lymph-node status, age and sex randomly selected from the same database.The analysis without correction for historical control bias showed lymph-node metastasis (P = 0.000), female sex (P = 0.002), depth of invasion (P = 0.001) and adjuvant chemotherapy (P = 0.03) as significant predictors of survival.

  {"id":"bifulcoHistoryHowViruses2022","abstract":"Since the nineteenth century, several reports in the historical medical literature emphasized that, occasionally, cancer patients showed a clinical remission, called \"Saint Peregrine tumor\" as a result of natural infections. Moreover, additional evidence indicated that viruses show a tropism toward cancer cells, leading to the discovery of oncolytic activity of several viruses, called oncolytic viruses (OVs). With the technological and scientific advancements, the advent of rodent models, the establishment of in vitro cell lines, the introduction of methods for virus propagation, several attempts through the 1950s and 1970s have been made to increase OVs specificity, efficacy and safety; however, inconclusive/negative results have been reached and many researchers abandoned the field. Only in the later 1990s, the genetic engineering and the recombinant DNA techniques that allowed the generation of potent, specific and safe OVs and a better understanding of cancer cells renewed the interest in virotherapy. Currently, virotherapy represents a cancer therapeutic strategy based on the use of OVs that selectively infect and lyse cancer cells, without harming normal cells. Over the past years, several \"natural\" and \"genetic engineered\" viruses, have been investigated in clinical studies and some of them revealed encouraging results. Recently, the clinical use of OVs has also been supported by the immune stimulatory property of OVs against tumor cells. Here, we analyze the early oncolytic virotherapy before genetic engineering to highlight the relevant progresses reached, and the mechanism to stimulate host immune response, a significant challenge in current virotherapy field.","author":[{"family":"Bifulco","given":"Maurizio"},{"family":"Di Zazzo","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Napolitano","given":"Fabiana"},{"family":"Malfitano","given":"Anna Maria"},{"family":"Portella","given":"Giuseppe"}],"citation-key":"bifulcoHistoryHowViruses2022","container-title":"Biochimie","container-title-short":"Biochimie","DOI":"10.1016/j.biochi.2022.10.008","ISSN":"1638-6183","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"S0300-9084(22)00275-9","PMID":"36273765","source":"PubMed","title":"History of how viruses can fight cancer: From the miraculous healings to the approval of oncolytic viruses","title-short":"History of how viruses can fight cancer","type":"article-journal"},
  {"id":"bishopCNSInvolvementPrimary1999","abstract":"PURPOSE: The risk of CNS involvement by non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) has been associated with bone marrow and/or testicular involvement; however, it was recently reported that the number of extranodal sites is a more reliable predictor of CNS disease. Because primary mediastinal thymic large B-cell lymphoma (PMLCL) has a high propensity for involving extranodal sites, we investigated the frequency and pattern of CNS involvement in PMLCL.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 219 patients with aggressive NHL, consecutively entered onto protocols at the National Cancer Institute between 1987 and 1998, were retrospectively reviewed.\nRESULTS: Twenty-three patients (11%) had clinical and pathologic features of PMLCL. These patients were young (median age, 29 years), female (61%), and presented with massive mediastinal adenopathy (70%). Extranodal disease occurred at presentation in 70% and at relapse in 93% of patients and involved contiguous intrathoracic structures and/or distant sites, including the lungs, kidneys, liver, adrenals, ovaries, pancreas, and bone. Six patients (26%) developed CNS involvement, two (9%) at presentation and four (27%) at relapse. All had extranodal disease, but only one had bone marrow involvement. Parenchymal and leptomeningeal CNS disease occurred in four and three patients, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: CNS involvement in PMLCL is associated with extranodal involvement other than bone marrow and may reflect the unique biology of this disease. The propensity to involve the CNS parenchyma raises the concern that intrathecal prophylaxis may not be effective and suggests that CNS imaging should be considered in patients with extranodal disease.","author":[{"family":"Bishop","given":"P.

  {"id":"bossetChemoradiotherapyFollowedSurgery1997","abstract":"BACKGROUND: We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial to compare preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with surgery alone in patients with stage I and II squamous-cell cancer of the esophagus.\nMETHODS: The preoperative combined therapy consisted of two one-week courses; each involved radiotherapy, in a dose of 18.5 Gy delivered in five fractions of 3.7 Gy each, and 80 mg of cisplatin per square meter of body-surface area, administered 0 to 2 days before the first day of radiotherapy. The surgical plan included one-stage en bloc esophagectomy and proximal gastrectomy by the abdominal and right thoracic routes, to be performed immediately after randomization in the group assigned to surgery alone and two to four weeks after the completion of preoperative chemoradiotherapy in the group assigned to combined therapy.\nRESULTS: A total of 297 patients entered the study; 11 were found to be ineligible, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 282, 139 were assigned to surgery alone and 143 to combined therapy. After a median follow-up of 55.2 months, no significant difference in overall survival was observed; the median survival was 18.6 months for both groups. As compared with the group treated with surgery alone, the group treated preoperatively had longer disease-free survival (P=0.003), a longer interval free of local disease (P=0.01), a lower rate of cancer-related deaths (P=0.002), and a higher frequency of curative resection (P=0.017). However, there were more postoperative deaths (P=0.012) in the group treated preoperatively with chemoradiotherapy. Three prognostic factors were found to influence survival in a multivariate analysis: the disease stage, based on computed tomography; the location of the tumor; and whether the surgical resection was curative.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with squamous-cell esophageal cancer, preoperative chemoradiotherapy did not improve overall survival, but it did prolong disease-free survival and survival free of local disease.","author":[{"family":"Bosset","given":"J.

At the same time, it is necessary to give uniformity in the supportive care protocols, as these preventive and therapeutic measures may influence the results of oncological treatments and their efficacy should be evaluated in a consistent manner. Several preventive and therapeutic interventions are available, particularly in the context of chemoradiotherapy, where the adverse events are more prominent. An accurate evaluation of the patient and a tailored approach with preventative indications and therapeutic interventions represent key factors. This approach could be easily identified within a “simultaneous care” strategy, as the optimal supportive measures are provided concurrently to the best therapeutic approach since the beginning of the treatment.","author":[{"family":"Bossi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Lorini","given":"Luigi"}],"citation-key":"bossiOptimalSupportiveMeasures2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_15","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

This case study describes lessons learned from Team Up, a model pilot program.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a descriptive qualitative case study including 5 Southern states and 1 Midwestern state: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The 6 states underwent a 5-step process to adopt, adapt, and implement 1 of 3 evidence-based interventions designed for cervical and breast cancer screening.\n\nOutcome\nThe 6 participating states had various levels of success. Participating states formed and sustained viable interorganizational public health partnerships throughout the pilot program and beyond.\n\nInterpretation\nAlthough this innovative pilot faced many difficulties, participants overcame substantial obstacles and produced many key accomplishments. Team Up brought together 2 challenging public health strategies: the translation of evidence-based approaches to communities and populations, and partnerships among diverse people and organizations.

Progress was slow from the first surgical repair of the esophagus in ancient Egypt in 2500 B.C. until the end of the 19th century, when scientific discoveries made possible the solid beginnings of abdominal surgery. Thoracic surgery followed in the 20th century, with rapid strides in World War II. These wartime advances stimulated an interest in esophageal surgery in the postwar era, when operative techniques became well standardized and surgery of the esophagus was placed on a par with that of other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Because of the limitations of time and space, much important material has had to be left out. Yet it is hoped that this brief historical overview will put in perspective the important advances of the second half of this century, which will be presented by our distinguished speakers.

  {"id":"bridgewaterLongTermOutcomesExploratory2022","abstract":"PURPOSE The BILCAP study described a modest benefit for capecitabine as adjuvant therapy for curatively resected biliary tract cancer (BTC), and capecitabine has become the standard of care. We present the long-term data and novel exploratory subgroup analyses. METHODS This randomized, controlled, multicenter, phase III study recruited patients age 18 years or older with histologically confirmed cholangiocarcinoma or muscle-invasive gallbladder cancer after resection with curative intent and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of < 2. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive oral capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle, for eight cycles) or observation. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). This study is registered with EudraCT 2005-003318-13. RESULTS Between March 15, 2006, and December 4, 2014, 447 patients were enrolled; 223 patients with BTC resected with curative intent were randomly assigned to the capecitabine group and 224 to the observation group. At the data cutoff of January 21, 2021, the median follow-up for all patients was 106 months (95% CI, 98 to 108). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the median OS was 49.6 months (95% CI, 35.1 to 59.1) in the capecitabine group compared with 36.1 months (95% CI, 29.7 to 44.2) in the observation group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.06). In a protocol-specified sensitivity analysis, adjusting for minimization factors, nodal status, grade, and sex, the OS hazard ratio was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.94). We further describe the prognostic impact of R status, grade, nodal status, and sex. CONCLUSION This long-term analysis supports the previous analysis, suggesting that capecitabine can improve OS in patients with resected BTC when used as adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery and should be considered as the standard of care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,29]]},"archive_location":"world","author":[{"family":"Bridgewater","given":"John"},{"family":"Fletcher","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Palmer","given":"Daniel H."},{"family":"Malik","given":"Hassan Z."},{"family":"Prasad","given":"Raj"},{"family":"Mirza","given":"Darius"},{"family":"Anthony","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Corrie","given":"Pippa"},{"family":"Falk","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Finch-Jones","given":"Meg"},{"family":"Wasan","given":"Harpreet"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Wall","given":"Lucy"},{"family":"Wadsley","given":"Jonathan"},{"family":"Evans","given":"Thomas R."},{"family":"Stocken","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Stubbs","given":"Clive"},{"family":"Praseedom","given":"Raaj"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Yuk Ting"},{"family":"Davidson","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Neoptolemos","given":"John"},{"family":"Iveson","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Cunningham","given":"David"},{"family":"Garden","given":"O.

There is no consensus on when to initiate MKI treatment. The objective of this study was to evaluate time to symptomatic progression (TTSP) in patients with RAI-R DTC for whom the decision to treat with an MKI was made at study entry.\n\nMethods: International, prospective, open-label, noninterventional cohort study (NCT02303444). Eligible patients had asymptomatic progressive RAI-R DTC, with ≥1 lesion ≥1 cm in diameter and life expectancy ≥6 months. The decision to treat with an MKI was at the treating physician's discretion. Primary endpoint was TTSP from study entry. Two cohorts were evaluated: patients for whom a decision to initiate an MKI was made at study entry (Cohort 1) and patients for whom there was a decision not to initiate an MKI at study entry (Cohort 2). Cohorts were compared descriptively.\n\nResults: The full analysis set (FAS) comprised 647 patients. The median duration of observation was 35.5 months (range <1–59.4). Of 344 MKI-treated patients, 209 received sorafenib, 191 received lenvatinib, and 19 received another MKI at some point. Median TTSP was 55.4 months (interquartile range [IQR] 18.6–not estimable [NE]) overall, 55.4 months (IQR 15.2–NE) in Cohort 1 (n = 169), and 51.4 months (IQR 20.0–NE) in Cohort 2 (n = 478). TTSP ≥36 months was achieved in 64.5% of patients overall, 59.5% of patients in Cohort 1, and 66.4% of patients in Cohort 2. Median overall survival from classification as RAI-R was 167 months and median progression-free survival from start of MKI therapy was 19.2 months and from start of sorafenib therapy 16.7 months. Among sorafenib-treated patients, 70% had dose modifications, 35% had a dose reduction, 89% experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 82% experienced ≥1 drug-related TEAE.\n\nConclusions: This real-world study provides valuable insight into outcomes in patients with asymptomatic, progressive RAI-R DTC under observation or receiving MKI treatment.

For social and political historians, he was a German nationalist whose book on medical education heralded the rise of anti-Semitism in the Austrian public sphere. This article brings together and critically reassesses these two hitherto separate accounts to show how, in a period of dramatic social and political change, Viennese surgery split into two camps. One, headed by Billroth, was characterized by an alliance with the German educational model, German nationalism leading to racial anti-Semitism and an experimental approach to the construction of surgical procedure, which heavily relied on the methods of pathological physiology. The other, which followed a long Austrian tradition, stood for a clinically-oriented and strictly organized medical education that catered to an ethnically and socially diverse population and, simultaneously, for an anatomically oriented surgery, largely of the locomotor apparatus. This study shows how, in a major centre of medical education and capital of a multiethnic empire, surgical and national identities were forged together.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Buklijas","given":"Tatjana"}],"citation-key":"buklijasSurgeryNationalIdentity2007","container-title":"Studies in history and philosophy of biological and biomedical sciences","container-title-short":"Stud Hist Philos Biol Biomed Sci","DOI":"10.1016/j.shpsc.2007.09.003","ISSN":"1369-8486","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",12]]},"page":"756-774","PMCID":"PMC2605547","PMID":"18053931","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Surgery and national identity in late nineteenth-century Vienna","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2605547/","volume":"38"},

  {"id":"busEffectSocioeconomicStatus2012","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment choice for patients with esophageal cancer (EC) is complex and largely determined by tumor characteristics, comorbidity, and age.\nGOALS: This study describes the role of patient characteristics, among which is socioeconomic status (SES), in EC treatment.\nSTUDY: Patients diagnosed with primary EC between 1990 and 2008 in the southern part of the Netherlands were identified using the Eindhoven Cancer Registry. Multivariable logistic and proportional hazard regression analyses were used to identify determinants of treatment and survival.\nRESULTS: We included 1914 patients, and 37% of them underwent intentionally curative treatment. Low-SES patients were diagnosed at older age (16% vs. 9%, age more than or equal to 80) and with more advanced tumor stages (13% vs. 10%, stage T4) than high-SES patients. Age less than 60 compared with 70 to 79 years [adjusted odds ratio, 4.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.98-6.84] and high SES compared with low SES (adjusted odds ratio 1.59; 95% CI, 1.07-2.37) were independent predictors for curative treatment. Probability of death for high-SES patients undergoing palliative treatment was decreased compared with low-SES patients (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71-0.99).\nCONCLUSIONS: SES is an important factor in treatment choice of EC. As health care is equally accessible to the whole population in the Netherlands, this suggests that both patient-related and physician-related factors are involved in this phenomenon.","author":[{"family":"Bus","given":"Pauline"},{"family":"Aarts","given":"Mieke J."},{"family":"Lemmens","given":"Valery E.

The aim of the present study was to review our experience using pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (pembro + CP) in patients with R/M SCCHN. This was a retrospective study of patients with R/M SCCHN who received pembro + CP in any-line via a compassionate-use program. The present study evaluated safety using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0, compliance, overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, duration of treatment, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Between March 2020 and August 2021, 10 patients were identified (median age, 64 years; female, 60%; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 2, 80%). A total of 8 patients received pembro + 3-weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel (3wkCP). A total of 2 patients received pembro + weekly carboplatin-paclitaxel (wkCP). Patients received a median of 3 lines (range, 0–6) of systemic therapy prior to pembro + CP and 80% received IO in previous lines. Grade 1–2 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 100% of patients. Grade 3–5 AEs occurred in 30% of patients [all grade 3 (anemia, neutropenia, thrombopenia, hypertension)]. The mean numbers of pembro + wkCP and pembro + 3wkCP cycles were 2.5 and 6. The ORR (n=7) was 14% (1/7) with one complete response. The DCR was 43% (3/7). The median PFS (n=7) and OS (n=10) times since pembro + CP were 5 months (95% CI, 1–9) and 6 months (95% CI, 0.5-14), respectively. In this small retrospective series of heavily pretreated patients, pembro + CP was well tolerated, and compliance was high. Studies should be conducted to prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of this combination in patients with R/M SCCHN.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Cabezas-Camarero","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Merino-Menéndez","given":"Salomé"},{"family":"Cabrera-Martín","given":"María Nieves"},{"family":"Sotelo","given":"Miguel J."},{"family":"Plaza-Hernández","given":"José Carlos"},{"family":"Falahat","given":"Farzin"},{"family":"Iglesias-Moreno","given":"María Cruz"},{"family":"Pérez-Segura","given":"Pedro"}],"citation-key":"cabezas-camareroSafetyPreliminaryActivity2022","container-title":"Oncology Letters","container-title-short":"Oncol Lett","DOI":"10.3892/ol.2022.13623","ISSN":"1792-1074","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,7]]},"page":"37","PMCID":"PMC9773311","PMID":"36589672","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Safety and preliminary activity of pembrolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel in heavily pretreated and/or fragile patients with PDL1-positive recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9773311/","volume":"25"},

In this study, we reexamined the clinicopathologic features and the response to current treatment of 141 PMLCL and compare them with 916 nonmediastinal large B-cell lymphomas (NMLCL) recorded in the same period and treated with similar combined chemotherapy. The clinical features of PMLCL at diagnosis were largely homogeneous and distinct from NMLCL, with a predilection for young women (59% with a mean age of 37 years versus 42% with a mean age of 54 years), bulky tumor (77% versus 7%, p < 10(4)), high serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level 76% versus 51%, p < 10(4)), and frequent intrathoracic extension to adjacent organs such as pleura, pericardium, and lung. By contrast, extrathoracic or hematologic dissemination was uncommon (2% of bone marrow involvement versus 17%). All patients had diffuse large B-cell nonimmunoblastic, nonanaplastic lymphomas. Histological analysis of the 141 PMLCL evaluated two common patterns: the presence of large cells with clear cytoplasm (found in 38% of cases) and the presence of fibrosis (marked in 25% of cases). The presence of clear cells or intense fibrosis did not constitute prognostic indicators. Immunologic and molecular analysis assessed the profile of bcl-2 expression and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in PMLCL: 30% expressed a high level of bcl-2 protein; EBER RNAs were detected by in situ hybridization in only two of the 41 cases tested. Monotypic light chain restriction could be demonstrated in seven of the 41 PMLCL tested on fixed-section. Treated with polychemotherapy regimens without radiotherapy, 79% of PMLCL patients achieved a complete remission compared with 68% in the NMLCL patient group (p = 0.01). Overall, 3-year survival rates were estimated at 66 and 61%, respectively (p = 0.05), and disease-free survival rates were not significantly different (61 versus 64%). Stratified analysis on the International Prognostic Index (based on age, tumor stage, serum LDH level, and performance status) showed no difference in the overall and disease-free survivals between the two lymphoma groups. In conclusion, PMLCL can be combined with other diffuse large B-cell lymphomas on morphologic grounds; it is not associated with EBV. It responds favorably to treatment and should be managed like other high-grade lymphomas of equivalent histology. However, the uncommon clinical presentation makes it a distinct entity.","author":[{"family":"Cazals-Hatem","given":"D."},{"family":"Lepage","given":"E."},{"family":"Brice","given":"P."},{"family":"Ferrant","given":"A."},{"family":"Agay","given":"M.

  {"id":"chenEsophagealPerforationConformal2014","abstract":"The aim of this study was to analyze the risk factors and prognosis for patients with esophageal perforation occurring during or after radiotherapy for esophageal carcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed 322 patients with esophageal carcinoma. These patients received radiotherapy for unresectable esophageal tumors, residual tumors after operation, or local recurrence. Of these, 12 had radiotherapy to the esophagus before being admitted, 68 patients had concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and 18 patients had esophageal perforation after RT (5.8%). Covered self-expandable metallic stents were placed in 11 patients. Two patients continued RT after stenting and control of infection; one of these suffered a new perforation, and the other had a massive hemorrhage. The median overall survival was 2 months (0-3 months) compared with 17 months in the non-perforation group. In univariate analysis, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) being ≤ 70, age younger than 60, T4 stage, a second course of radiotherapy to the esophagus, extracapsular lymph nodes (LN) involving the esophagus, a total dose >100 Gy (biologically effective dose-10), and CRT were risk factors for perforation. In multivariate analysis, age younger than 60, extracapsular LN involving the esophagus, T4 stage, and a second course of radiotherapy to the esophagus were risk factors. In conclusion, patients with T4 stage, extracapsular LN involving the esophagus, and those receiving a second course of RT should be given particular care to avoid perforation.

Only patients with radically resected ESCC who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy or adjuvant radiotherapy were enrolled in this study. Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to balance the baseline.\nRESULTS: A total of 1,249 patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study, and 263 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. After matching, 260 pairs were analyzed. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were 93.4%, 66.1% and 59.6%, respectively, for patients with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with 83.8%, 58.4% and 48.8%, respectively, for patients with surgery alone (P = 0.003).

The current standard treatment for newly diagnosed PMBCL has long been dependent on a dose-intensive, dose-adjusted multi-agent chemotherapy regimen of rituximab plus etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (DA-R-EPOCH). Recent randomized trials have provided evidence that R-CHOP followed by consolidation radiotherapy (RT) is a valuable alternative option to first-line treatment. For recurrent/refractory PMBCL (rrPMBCL), new drugs such as pembrolizumab and CAR-T cell therapy have proven to be effective in a few studies. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is the preferred imaging modality of choice for the initial phase of lymphoma treatment and to assess response to treatment. In the future, baseline quantitative PET-CT can be used to predict prognosis in PMBCL.

  {"id":"chenPriorThyroidNonthyroid2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: A prior history of thyroid and non-thyroid malignancies has traditionally been an exclusion criterion in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) seeking to enroll in clinical trials. In this study, we examined the impact of prior malignancies on overall survival in patients diagnosed with ATC.\nMETHODS: In our retrospective cohort study, we identified 451 patients with ATC treated at MD Anderson between 2000-2019. Clinical and pathological information were obtained through chart review. Survival analyses were conducted using Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.\nRESULTS: A history of clinically documented prior differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) was reported in 14% of patients with ATC (n=62), most commonly papillary thyroid carcinoma (81%, n=50). The median time from diagnosis of prior DTC to ATC diagnosis was 3.5 years (range: 6 months to 35 years). Concomitant DTC was found on pathology in a higher proportion of patients (52%, n=234). A history of non-thyroid cancer was reported in 23% of patients (n=102), where 19% (n=87) had one, 2% (n=10) had two, and 1% (n=5) had three prior cancers. The median time from diagnosis of prior non-thyroid cancer to ATC diagnosis was 8 years (range: 3 months to 53 years). The most common prior non-thyroid cancers were non-melanoma skin (28.4%), prostate (19.6%), and breast cancer (16.7%). In a subgroup analysis performed in patients with available tumor mutation information (n=183), the frequency of detected tumor driver mutations (BRAF, RAS, TP53) was not significantly different between patients with ATC with and without a history of prior non-thyroid cancer. On multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and overall stage, prior DTC, concomitant DTC, and prior non-thyroid cancers all had no significant impact on overall survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: The presence of prior malignancy does not significantly impact overall survival in patients with ATC.

Favorable outcomes are rare but help decipher molecular pathophysiology, investigate prognosis factors, and discover new therapeutic targets.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Two patients were diagnosed with locally advanced nonresectable ATC, one with metastatic extension. Each patient received chemotherapy and radiotherapy, allowing thyroid surgical resection. In both cases, the pathological examination was consistent with complete response with no viable tumor cells. After follow-ups of 48 and 70 months, both patients remain disease-free. Molecular explorations on thyroid biopsies revealed microsatellite instability (MSI) and alterations on mismatch repair-gene complex, also PTEN and ATM variants in both cases. Both also presented with non-classical immune infiltrate composed of equal parts T CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages.\nCONCLUSION: We report two cases of patients cured from advanced ATC and for the first time provide genetic and immunological explorations in this setting. It seems with these two cases that MSI-ATCs may indicate a better prognosis.

  {"id":"chopadeCommonIliacNodePositive2022","abstract":"Purpose\nCommon iliac (CI) nodes are staged as (oligo)metastatic M1a for prostate cancer. Whether outcomes of pelvic node-positive (cN1) differ from CI node-positive (CI-M1a) prostate cancer after curative treatment is unclear. The present study compares outcomes in patients treated with radical whole pelvic radiation therapy (RT) and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).\nMethods and Materials\nPatients with a node-positive adenocarcinoma prostate were identified, either CI-M1a or cN1, from a prospectively maintained database. More than 75% of patients were staged with Gallium (Ga) 68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) at the time of diagnosis. All patients received long-term ADT and moderately or extremely hypofractionated RT to the prostate and pelvis, including the CI region. At the time of biochemical failure (BCF), restaging was done with Ga68-PSMA-PET/CT to establish the patterns of failure. The CI-M1a cohort was classified as proximal or distal CI nodal location, and studied for outcomes.\nResults\nOf the 130 patients analyzed, 87 had cN1 and 43 had CI-M1a stage disease. The median duration of ADT before RT was 7 months, and total duration was at least 24 months. The majority of patients (65%) had Gleason grade group IV to V, and 75% had ≥T3 disease. After a median follow up of 61 months, BCF in the 2 groups was similar (cN1: n = 21 of 87; 24.1%; CI-M1a: n = 11 of 43; 25.6%; P = .86). At the time of BCF, restaging Ga68-PSMA-PET/CT located distant metastases in 20 of 32 patients (63%; 57% in cN1 and 73% in CI-M1a; P = .47). In addition, the 5-year biochemical failure-free (cN1: 77.4%; CI-M1a: 70.4%; P = .43), distant metastasis-free (cN1: 86.9%; CI-M1a: 79.4%; P = .23), and overall (cN1: 92.6%; CI-M1a 90.1%; P = .80) survival were similar in the 2 groups. Outcomes within CI-M1a were similar for proximal versus distal CI nodal location and 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (73.6% vs 58.6%; P = .81).\nConclusions\nPatients with oligometastatic CI-M1a and cN1 prostate cancer showed similar outcomes when treated with curative whole pelvic RT and long-term ADT. The treatment for these oligometastatic patients should be prospectively evaluated.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",2,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Chopade","given":"Pradnya"},{"family":"Maitre","given":"Priyamvada"},{"family":"David","given":"Sam"},{"family":"Panigrahi","given":"Gitanjali"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Pallavi"},{"family":"Phurailatpam","given":"Reena"},{"family":"Murthy","given":"Vedang"}],"citation-key":"chopadeCommonIliacNodePositive2022","collection-title":"A Red Journal Special Issue: Oligometastasis, Part I","container-title":"International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics","container-title-short":"International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics","DOI":"10.1016/j.ijrobp.2022.07.011","ISSN":"0360-3016","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"page":"711-717","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Common Iliac Node-Positive Prostate Cancer Treated With Curative Radiation Therapy: N1 or M1a?","title-short":"Common Iliac Node-Positive Prostate Cancer Treated With Curative Radiation Therapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301622007313","volume":"114"},

The positive results of dabrafenib and trametinib for ATC harboring the BRAF V600E mutation have provided a useful treatment option. For the other genetic profiles, different drugs are available and can be used to individualize the treatment, likely using drug combinations. Combinations of drugs act on different molecular pathways and achieve inhibition at separate areas. With new targeted therapies, average survival has improved considerably and death from local disease progression or airway compromise is less likely with improvement in quality of life. Unfortunately, the results remain poor in terms of survival.","author":[{"family":"Coca-Pelaz","given":"Andrés"},{"family":"Rodrigo","given":"Juan P."},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Shah","given":"Jatin P."},{"family":"Silver","given":"Carl E."},{"family":"Al Ghuzlan","given":"Abir"},{"family":"Menke-van der Houven van Oordt","given":"C.

  {"id":"cogleIncidenceMyelodysplasticSyndromes2011","abstract":"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are hematologically diverse hematopoietic stem cell malignancies primarily affecting older individuals. The incidence of MDS in the United States is estimated at 3.3 per 100 000; however, evidence suggests underreporting of MDS to centralized cancer registries. Contrary to clinical recommendations, registry guidelines from 2001-2010 required the capture of only one malignancy in the myeloid lineage and did not require blood count (BC) or bone marrow (BM) biopsy for MDS confirmation. To address these potential limitations, we constructed 4 claims-based algorithms to assess MDS incidence, applied the algorithms to the 2000-2008 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, and assessed algorithm validity using SEER-registered MDS cases. Each algorithm required one or more MDS claims and accounted for recommended diagnostic services during the year before the first claim: 1+, 2+, 2 + BC, and 2 + BCBM (ordered by sensitivity). Each had moderate sensitivities (78.05%-92.90%) and high specificities (98.49%-99.84%), with the 2 + BCBM algorithm demonstrating the highest specificity. Based on the 2 + BCBM algorithm, the annual incidence of MDS is 75 per 100 000 persons 65 years or older-much higher than the 20 per 100 000 reported by SEER using the same sample.","author":[{"family":"Cogle","given":"Christopher R."},{"family":"Craig","given":"Benjamin M."},{"family":"Rollison","given":"Dana E."},{"family":"List","given":"Alan F."}],"citation-key":"cogleIncidenceMyelodysplasticSyndromes2011","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2011-02-337964","ISSN":"1528-0020","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6,30]]},"language":"eng","page":"7121-7125","PMCID":"PMC3143554","PMID":"21531980","source":"PubMed","title":"Incidence of the myelodysplastic syndromes using a novel claims-based algorithm: high number of uncaptured cases by cancer registries","title-short":"Incidence of the myelodysplastic syndromes using a novel claims-based algorithm","type":"article-journal","volume":"117"},

Interventions Combined modality therapy (n = 134): 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, plus cisplatin intravenously on the first day of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11, and fluorouracil, 1 g/m2 per day by continuous infusion on the first 4 days of weeks 1, 5, 8, and 11.

In the randomized part of the trial, at 5 years of follow-up the overall survival for combined therapy was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15%-37%) compared with 0% following RT. In the succeeding nonrandomized part, combined therapy produced a 5-year overall survival of 14% (95% CI, 6%-23%). Persistence of disease (despite therapy) was the most common mode of treatment failure; however, it was less common in the groups receiving combined therapy (34/130 [26%]) than in the group treated with RT only (23/62 [37%]). Severe acute toxic effects also were greater in the combined therapy groups. There were no significant differences in severe late toxic effects between the groups. However, chemotherapy could be administered as planned in only 89 (68%) of 130 patients (10% had life-threatening toxic effects with combined therapy vs 2% in the RT only group).\nCONCLUSION: Combined therapy increases the survival of patients who have squamous cell or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, T1-3 N0-1 M0, compared with RT alone.","author":[{"family":"Cooper","given":"J.

  {"id":"copurPotentialCostSavings2018","abstract":"Purpose Increasing new cancer cases and approval of effective but expensive new drugs extending survival have led to unsustainable cancer care costs. Potential cost savings by a hypothetical dose down-rounding project of monoclonal antibodies at a community-based cancer center is presented. Methods From October 2014 through October 2015, metastatic cancer patients receiving monoclonal antibodies at CHI-Health St Francis Cancer Treatment Center in Grand Island, Nebraska, were identified through electronic health records. A total of 11 different types of monoclonal antibodies that were administered during the study period were identified. Trastuzumab, ofatumumab, and obinutuzumab did not require dose-rounding; thus, they were excluded from the analyses. Available vial size(s) and costs per milligram per average wholesale price for each monoclonal antibody were recorded. Costs of actual amounts prescribed were compared to the costs of theoretically reduced ≤5% and ≤10% doses rounded to the nearest vial sizes. Reduced doses resulting in a decreased number of opened vials qualified for meaningful dose down-rounding and were included in the analysis. Average actual dose reduction percentage resulting in cost savings for both groups was also calculated. Results A total of 728 doses of eight monoclonal antibodies suitable for dose down-rounding were identified. Vial sizes of pembrolizumab and ipilimumab did not allow for a meaningful dose down-rounding. At the ≤5% dose down-rounding, 255 of 728 doses (35%) qualified with a potential annual cost savings of $220,793.80. At the ≤10% dose down-rounding, 526 of 728 doses (72%) qualified with a potential annual cost savings of $454,461.00. The average actual dose reduction was 2.4% for the ≤5% dose reduction group and 4.9% for the ≤10% dose reduction group. Overall average cost savings per qualifying dose reduction was around $865.00. More doses qualified for cost savings in the ≤10% dose reduction group. Significant differences between different monoclonal antibodies for dose rounding at either ≤5% (p = 0.002) or ≤10% (p < 0.001) were observed. Conclusion A practical dose down-rounding procedure may allow significant cost reduction in metastatic cancer setting, where the cure is not the goal. Drug waste can be avoided by convenient vial sizes or can even be eliminated by lyophilized forms like in trastuzumab. Our data reflect the monoclonal antibody use and potential cost savings with the proposed dose down-rounding approach in a community-based cancer program.","author":[{"family":"Copur","given":"Mehmet S."},{"family":"Gnewuch","given":"Curtis"},{"family":"Schriner","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Tharnish","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Gonen","given":"Mithat"},{"family":"McDonald","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Kezeor","given":"Jami"},{"family":"Ramaekers","given":"Ryan C."},{"family":"Gauchan","given":"Dron"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Douglas"},{"family":"Greenwalt","given":"Lois"},{"family":"Mickey","given":"Mary"},{"family":"Norvell","given":"Max"}],"citation-key":"copurPotentialCostSavings2018","container-title":"Journal of Oncology Pharmacy Practice: Official Publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners","container-title-short":"J Oncol Pharm Pract","DOI":"10.1177/1078155217692400","ISSN":"1477-092X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"116-120","PMID":"29284380","source":"PubMed","title":"Potential cost savings by dose down-rounding of monoclonal antibodies in a community cancer center","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"cunhaMycoplasmaPneumoniaeCommunityacquired2009","abstract":"The most common cause of nonzoonotic atypical community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is Mycoplasma pneumoniae. M. pneumoniae CAP is most common in young adults but may occur at any age. Like other atypical CAPs, M. pneumoniae is associated with a characteristic pattern of extrapulmonary organ involvement and nonspecific laboratory tests. M. pneumoniae CAP is frequently accompanied by gastrointestinal manifestations (eg, loose stools/diarrhea), nonexudative pharyngitis, or skin involvement (ie, erythemamultiforme). Central nervous system involvement with M. pneumoniae is rare and accompanied by highly elevated cold agglutinin titers. Cardiac, hepatic, and renal involvement are not features of M. pneumoniae CAP. Because M. pneumoniae CAP is most frequent in ambulatory young adults, it is an easily overlooked diagnosis in elderly patients hospitalized with CAP. The hallmark clinical finding of M. pneumoniae CAP is protracted nonproductive cough. The characteristic nonspecific laboratory test finding uniquely associated with M. pneumoniae CAP is elevated cold agglutinin titers. Seventy-five percent of patients with M. pneumoniae infection have elevated cold agglutinin titers. However, the absence of elevated cold agglutinin titers does not argue against the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae. If cold agglutinins are present in a patient with CAP, the higher the cold agglutinin titer is (>1:64), the more likely the cold agglutinins are due to M. pneumoniae. Q fever is the only other atypical CAP that is rarely associated with cold agglutinins. We present a hospitalized patient with CAP in whom all microbiologic and serologic diagnostic test results were negative during the first week of her hospitalization. M. pneumoniae CAP was not suspected because of her age. Her initial M. pneumoniae immunoglobulin-M and cold agglutinin titers were negative. During the second week of hospitalization, an increased platelet count was noted. It is a common misconception that acute thrombocytosis is an acute phase reactant. Her acute thrombocytosis increased and persisted. The diagnostic clue to the cause of this hospitalized patient with CAP was acute thrombocytosis. In a patient with CAP, acute thrombocytosis is usually associated with Q fever pneumonia and less commonly with M. pneumoniae. If Q fever can be excluded on the basis of a recent/proximate zoonotic vector contact history, then acute thrombocytosis is an important clue to M. pneumoniae CAP. Acute thrombocytosis due to M. pneumoniae and Q fever occurs during weeks 1 and 2 of the infection. In patients with CAP, acute thrombocytosis that occurs during weeks 1 and 2 of the illness should suggest M. pneumoniae in patients without recent zoonotic vector contact history.","author":[{"family":"Cunha","given":"Burke A."},{"family":"Pherez","given":"Francisco M."}],"citation-key":"cunhaMycoplasmaPneumoniaeCommunityacquired2009","container-title":"Heart & Lung: The Journal of Critical Care","container-title-short":"Heart Lung","DOI":"10.1016/j.hrtlng.2008.10.005","ISSN":"1527-3288","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"eng","page":"444-449","PMID":"19755196","source":"PubMed","title":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the elderly: Diagnostic significance of acute thrombocytosis","title-short":"Mycoplasma pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the elderly","type":"article-journal","volume":"38"},
  {"id":"cunninghamPerioperativeChemotherapySurgery2006","abstract":"BACKGROUND: A regimen of epirubicin, cisplatin, and infused fluorouracil (ECF) improves survival among patients with incurable locally advanced or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. We assessed whether the addition of a perioperative regimen of ECF to surgery improves outcomes among patients with potentially curable gastric cancer.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach, esophagogastric junction, or lower esophagus to either perioperative chemotherapy and surgery (250 patients) or surgery alone (253 patients). Chemotherapy consisted of three preoperative and three postoperative cycles of intravenous epirubicin (50 mg per square meter of body-surface area) and cisplatin (60 mg per square meter) on day 1, and a continuous intravenous infusion of fluorouracil (200 mg per square meter per day) for 21 days. The primary end point was overall survival.\nRESULTS: ECF-related adverse effects were similar to those previously reported among patients with advanced gastric cancer. Rates of postoperative complications were similar in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and the surgery group (46 percent and 45 percent, respectively), as were the numbers of deaths within 30 days after surgery. The resected tumors were significantly smaller and less advanced in the perioperative-chemotherapy group. With a median follow-up of four years, 149 patients in the perioperative-chemotherapy group and 170 in the surgery group had died. As compared with the surgery group, the perioperative-chemotherapy group had a higher likelihood of overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.75; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.93; P=0.009; five-year survival rate, 36 percent vs. 23 percent) and of progression-free survival (hazard ratio for progression, 0.66; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.53 to 0.81; P<0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with operable gastric or lower esophageal adenocarcinomas, a perioperative regimen of ECF decreased tumor size and stage and significantly improved progression-free and overall survival.

Compared to patients with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) where chemotherapy is utilized ubiquitously, chemotherapy may play a more select role in patients with certain types of NETs (e.g., pancreatic tumors, higher grade tumors, and tumors possessing DNA damage repair defects). The primary types of chemotherapy that have been tested in patients with NETs include alkylating agent- and platinum agent-based combinations. Across regimens, chemotherapy appears to elicit greater antitumor activity in patients with pancreatic or grade 3 NETs. The role for chemotherapy in lower grade extra-pancreatic NETs remains undefined. Furthermore, while chemotherapy has demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit for patients in the systemic setting, its role in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting is as-of-yet undetermined.

  {"id":"dasilvaImmunotherapyAdvancedEsophageal2021","abstract":"Esophageal cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with an estimated 544 076 deaths in 2020. It is also the seventh most incident cancer globally, with more than 50% of cases occurring in China alone. The diagnosis typically occurs in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease, when palliative chemotherapy is the primary treatment option, and the 5-year survival rates can be as low as 5%. Esophageal cancer can be classified by histology as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the most common among Western populations, occurs most often in the lower esophagus near the gastric junction, and is associated with obesity, gastric reflux, and a precursor state termed Barrett esophagus. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma occurs predominantly in the upper and mid-esophagus and is associated with smoking and alcohol exposure, although ESCC risk factors among non-Western populations are less known. These histologies differ in risk factors, prognosis, and genetics. Despite ESCC’s high incidence, to our knowledge, robust clinical trials are scarce, and most of the evidence guiding its treatment comes from studies assessing ESCC and EAC combined. There has been little progress in treating esophageal cancer over the last 2 decades, with median overall survival (OS) for these patients remaining close to 11 months.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"DaSilva","given":"Laercio Lopes"},{"family":"Aguiar","given":"Pedro Nazareth","suffix":"Jr"},{"family":"Lima Lopes","given":"Gilberto","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"dasilvaImmunotherapyAdvancedEsophageal2021","container-title":"JAMA Oncology","container-title-short":"JAMA Oncology","DOI":"10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.4410","ISSN":"2374-2437","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,1]]},"page":"1613-1614","source":"Silverchair","title":"Immunotherapy for Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma—Renewed Enthusiasm and a Lingering Challenge","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.4410","volume":"7"},

The incidence of all NETs, and specifically GEP NETs, has risen exponentially over the last three decades. Only within the past several years have these tumors been appropriately classified, allowing for meaningful drug development. Broadly, some of the most exciting drug classes being developed for patients with well-differentiated GEP NETs include newer types of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) or combinations which increase the potency of lutetium-177 (\n              177\n              Lu)-Dotatate, novel multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) and immunotherapy modalities, beyond checkpoint inhibitors, which seek to unleash the immune system against NETs. Specifically looking at newer types of PRRT, somatostatin receptor antagonists and alpha-emitter radionuclides each have demonstrated the ability to elicit greater DNA damage than\n              177\n              Lu-Dotatate in preclinical models.

Other RTKIs which are further along the clinical development spectrum and have demonstrated benefit in randomized trials include surufatinib and pazopanib. And though single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitors have not demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in patients with GEP NETs, outside of certain biomarker selected subsets, somatostatin receptor-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and vaccines such as SurVaxM, which targets survivin, represent two means through which NET-directed immunity may be modulated.

  {"id":"delmanNarrativeReviewSocioeconomic2021","abstract":"The persistent challenges of disparities in healthcare have led to significantly distinct outcomes among patients from different racial, ethnic, and underserved populations. Esophageal Cancer, not unlike other surgical diseases, has seen significant disparities in care. Esophageal cancer is currently the 6th leading cause of death from cancer and the 8th most common cancer in the world. Surgical disparities in the care of patients with Esophageal Cancer have been described in the literature, with a prevailing theme associating minority status with worse outcomes. The goal of this review is to provide an updated account of the literature on disparities in Esophageal Cancer presentation and treatment. We will approach this task through a conceptual framework that highlights the five main themes of surgical disparities: patient-level factors, provider-level factors, system and access issues, clinical care and quality, and postoperative outcomes, care and rehabilitation. All five categories play a complex role in the delivery of high-quality, equitable care for patients with Esophageal Cancer. While describing disparities in care is the first step to correcting them, moving forward, we should focus on developing effective interventions to mitigate disparities, policies linking disparities to quality-of-care metrics, and delivery system change to enable minority patients to more easily access high volume centers.","author":[{"family":"Delman","given":"Aaron M."},{"family":"Ammann","given":"Allison M."},{"family":"Turner","given":"Kevin M."},{"family":"Vaysburg","given":"Dennis M."},{"family":"Van Haren","given":"Robert M."}],"citation-key":"delmanNarrativeReviewSocioeconomic2021","container-title":"Journal of Thoracic Disease","container-title-short":"J Thorac Dis","DOI":"10.21037/jtd-20-3095","ISSN":"2072-1439","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"3801-3808","PMCID":"PMC8264668","PMID":"34277070","source":"PubMed","title":"A narrative review of socioeconomic disparities in the treatment of esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

The identification of local risk factors of oesophageal cancer will make it simple to design a focused intervention. On local risk factors, there is, however, a shortage of empirical evidence. Therefore, the aim of study was to identify local risk factors.\nMETHODS: An unmatched case control study design was employed. From February 2019 to August 2020, 338 histologically confirmed cases and 338 controls were recruited consecutively from six health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital city. To collect data from the cases and the controls, face to face interviews were conducted. Epi-info version 7 was used to enter and cleaned data, and SPSS version 23 was used to analyze it. The odds ratio was calculated based on hierarchal model multivariable logistic regression, and statistically significance was declared at p-value of <0.05.\nRESULTS: The mean (SD) age of the cases and the controls was 54.3 ± 12.5 years old and 40.2 ± 13.7 years old, respectively. The odds of oesophageal cancer was significantly higher among older ages (OR =11.0, 95% CI [6.60, 20.91]), rural residents (OR = 4.2, 95% CI [1.04, 16.80]), and those who had history of smoking (OR =1.3, 95% CI [1.12, 1.60]), khat chewing (OR = 4.0, 95% CI [2.50, 6.60]), raw meat consumers (OR = 2.6, 95% CI [1.75, 3.90]). Increasing monthly income (OR = 0.2, CI 95% [0.09, 0.49]) and a habit of eating fruits or vegetables (OR = 0.49, 95% CI [0.32, 0.76]) were associated with lower risks.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking, khat chewing, age, residency, and red raw meat consumption were discovered to be positive predictors of oesophageal cancer, whereas fruit or vegetable consumption and higher monthly income were discovered to be inversely associated. It is advised to avoid the use of khat and tobacco, as well as to avail fruits and vegetables in dish.","author":[{"family":"Dessalegn","given":"Berhe"},{"family":"Enqueselassie","given":"Fikre"},{"family":"Kaba","given":"Mirgissa"},{"family":"Assefa","given":"Mathewos"},{"family":"Addissie","given":"Adamu"}],"citation-key":"dessalegnRiskFactorsOesophageal2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.997158","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"997158","PMCID":"PMC9530820","PMID":"36203447","source":"PubMed","title":"Risk factors of oesophageal cancer at health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: Unmatched case control study","title-short":"Risk factors of oesophageal cancer at health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"dietzSurgicalApproachElderly2021","abstract":"Despite the fact that elderly people are the main incidental and continuously growing patient group with head and neck cancer, prospective trials focusing on special issues regarding head and neck surgery in elderlies are missing. To avoid complications during and after surgery in that patient category, comprehensive evaluation of functional status, comorbidities, performance status, social support and mental condition is mandatory. Regarding functional parameters, cardiac and respiratory conditions play a major role for any primary surgical procedure. Nevertheless, other comorbidities, medication and patients view on self-determination have carefully to be taken into consideration. It has repeatedly been shown that fit elderly individuals may benefit from intensive therapies like reconstructive surgery with microvascular free tissue transfer, concurrent chemoradiotherapy in the locoregionally advanced disease setting, and even from the standard first- and second-line palliative systemic therapies. Since it is well known that tolerance of systemic nonsurgical treatments in elderly people is less and therefore death from noncancer-related causes in that population is higher, moderate surgical procedures can be even more effective regarding quality of life in situations facing higher comorbidities, or functional constraints with limited life expectancy compared to nonsurgical standard approaches. Older people usually are at increased risk of postoperative complications. In particular, organ failure progresses much faster in multiple organ failure. The preoperative clarification of comorbidity for the avoidance of surgical complications is therefore of major importance. Close coordination with anesthesia and rapid postoperative mobilization are essential for this. Decision-making and treatment based on specific assessment in an experienced multidisciplinary team is key.","author":[{"family":"Dietz","given":"Andreas"}],"citation-key":"dietzSurgicalApproachElderly2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_8","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

While infection rates have been reported for MDS patients enrolled in clinical trials, the real-world incidence of infections that require hospitalization, and how disease related factors (e.g. genetic mutations) affect the likelihood of infection remain unclear. Methods: Clinical data for MDS pts (per 2016 WHO criteria) diagnosed between 1/2010-12/2016, and treated at the Cleveland Clinic were included. TET2 mutation data obtained by NGS (in the context of genomic panel) was also included. Results: Our dataset included 214 pts of median age 70 years (range 13-99), with 33%, 54%, and 12% having low, intermediate, and high risk MDS according to IPSS-R. Overall, 100 admissions for neutropenic fever were recorded with a median length of stay of 5 days per admission; 63 (29%) pts required at least one admission, and of these 9 (14%) pts required 3 or more (up to 6) admissions. Blood cultures were positive in 17 (27%) pts with common organisms including Staphylococcus (38%), Enterococcus (35%), and Pseudomonas (12%). Urine cultures were positive in 6 (10%) pts, with organisms including E. Coli (50%), Pseudomonas (17%) and Klebsiella (17%). Fungal work up was sent in 18 (29%) pts and was positive in 3 (17%) pts. 13 (21%) pts required ICU transfer, and of those 7 (51%) pts required vasopressor support, and 10 (77%) pts required mechanical ventilation. Median ICU length of stay was 3 days (range 1-26). 13 (21%) pts were discharged on IV antibiotics. Median OS for the entire cohort was 18 months (95% CI 7.9 – 34.7), and median OS for admitted patients was not significantly shorter at 48 or 65 months. The number of admissions for neutropenic fever, length of stay, IPSS-R risk category, TET2 mutation, and ICU transfer did not impact survival. Conclusions: The risk of admission for neutropenic fever was 29% with blood cultures positive in 27% of pts.

Predicting which cancer patients are at higher risk of readmission would improve post-discharge follow-up/navigation, decrease cost, and improve pt outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of non-surgical cancer pts hospitalized at our center between 12/2014 to 7/2018. A machine learning algorithm was trained on 348 medical, sociodemographic and cancer-specific variables with a total of 1,801,944 data points. The cohort was randomly divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets. Prediction performance was measured by area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A total of 5,178 hospitalizations were included, of which 45.1% were women, and 27.6% experienced an unplanned readmission within 30 days. The most frequently represented cancers were hematologic malignancies (30.5%), followed by GI (18.1%), lung (13.7%), and GU (10.9%). Significant variables that impacted the algorithm decision are ranked from the most to the least important, including: days from last admission; planned index chemotherapy admission; number of vascular access lines, drains, and airways in use; length of stay; cancer diagnosis; total ED visits in past 6 months; age; discharge lab values (sodium, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, platelets); number of prior admissions; and discharge disposition. The AUC for the validation subset was 0.80. To ease the translation of this model into the clinic, we developed a web application whereby users can supply the aforementioned variables to the model and receive a personalized prediction that highlights those variables most affecting a subject’s readmission risk status: www.Cancer-Readmission.com. Conclusions: A cancer-specific readmission risk model with high AUC for 30-days unplanned readmission has been developed. The model is embedded in a freely available web application that provides personalized, patient-specific predictions. Programs that integrate this model can identify cancer patients with a greater risk for unplanned hospital readmission, thus providing a personalized approach to prevent future unplanned readmissions.","author":[{"family":"Shreve","given":"Jacob Tyler"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Felix","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Benish Shirley","given":"Rachel"},{"family":"Hilton","given":"Cameron Beau"},{"family":"Radakovich","given":"Nathan"},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"James"},{"family":"Montero","given":"Alberto J."},{"family":"Nazha","given":"Aziz"}],"citation-key":"doi:10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15\\_suppl.7057","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15\\_suppl.7057","issue":"15_suppl","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"page":"7057-7057","title":"A personalized prediction model for hospital readmission risk for cancer patients.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO.2020.38.15_suppl.7057","volume":"38"},

Results from the esophageal carcinoma cohort are reported herein.\n\nPatients and Methods\n\nEligible patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction in whom standard therapy failed and who had PD-L1–positive tumors received pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Response was assessed every 8 weeks up to 6 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. Primary end points were safety and overall response rate, determined by investigator review per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1).\n\nResults\n\nAmong 83 patients with esophageal carcinoma and samples evaluable for PD-L1 expression, 37 (45%) had PD-L1–positive tumors, and 23 were enrolled. Median age was 65 years; 78% had squamous histology; and 87% received ≥ two prior therapies for advanced/metastatic disease. As of the data cutoff (February 20, 2017), median follow-up was 7 months (range, 1 to 33 months). Nine patients (39%) experienced treatment-related adverse events, most commonly decreased appetite, decreased lymphocyte count, generalized rash, and rash (two patients [9%] each). No grade 4 adverse events or deaths were attributed to pembrolizumab. Overall response rate was 30% (95% CI, 13% to 53%); median duration of response was 15 months (range, 6 to 26 months).

  {"id":"duanEfficacySafetyFirst2023","abstract":"Immunotherapy-based regiments have potential as first-line treatment for advanced gastric esophageal cancer. The present study aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of the association between the efficacy and safety of first-line immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric esophageal cancer. Subgroup analysis of patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) was conducted to identify the characteristics of patients with immune benefit and to provide a decision-making basis for clinical practice. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and other databases were searched to collect randomized controlled trials of immunotreatment-based regimens (experimental group) versus conventional first-line chemotherapy regimens (control group) for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric esophageal cancer. The main outcome measures included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, disease control rate and safety, and the secondary outcomes were the differences in OS and PFS between patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 and those with PD-L1 CPS <10. In addition, Asian and non-Asian populations were analysed. Nine studies with a total of 6,820 patients were included. The OS of patients treated with immunotherapy-based regimens was significantly longer than that of those treated with chemotherapy alone [HR=0.74; 95% CI (0.69, 0.80); P<0.00001]. The OS of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 and PD-L1 CPS <10 in the experimental group was significantly longer than that of patients in the control group [HR=0.68; 95% CI (0.59, 0.77); P<0.00001 and HR=0.73; 95% CI (0.62, 0.87); P=0.0005]. The PFS of patients being treated with immunotherapy-based regimens was significantly longer than that of those treated with chemotherapy alone [HR=0.71; 95% CI (0.59, 0.86); P=0.0003]. In addition, the PFS of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 and PD-L1 CPS <10 in the experimental group was significantly longer than that of patients in the control group [HR=0.67; 95% CI (0.49, 0.92); P=0.01 and HR=0.63; 95% CI (0.48, 0.83); P=0.001]. There was no significant difference in the overall incidence of adverse events and the incidence of grade 3 or above adverse events between the experimental and control groups [RR=1; 95% CI (0.99, 1.02); P=0.65 and RR=0.97; 95% CI (0.84, 1.12); P=0.69, respectively]. In conclusion, treatment with immunotherapy-based regimens may prolong the OS of patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic gastric esophageal cancer and this treatment regimen is safe compared with chemotherapy alone.","author":[{"family":"Duan","given":"Xiaoyang"},{"family":"Du","given":"Huazhen"},{"family":"Qi","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Yuan","given":"Meng"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jian"}],"citation-key":"duanEfficacySafetyFirst2023","container-title":"Experimental and Therapeutic Medicine","container-title-short":"Exp Ther Med","DOI":"10.3892/etm.2023.11915","ISSN":"1792-1015","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"216","PMCID":"PMC10133786","PMID":"37123204","source":"PubMed","title":"The efficacy and safety of first‑line anti‑PD‑1/PD‑L1 immunotherapy for gastric esophageal cancer: A systematic review and meta‑analysis of phase III randomized controlled trials","title-short":"The efficacy and safety of first‑line anti‑PD‑1/PD‑L1 immunotherapy for gastric esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

  {"id":"eliaMolecularFeaturesAggressive2022","abstract":"Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) have a worse prognosis with respect to well differentiated TC, and the loss of the capability of up-taking 131I is one of the main features characterizing aggressive TC. The knowledge of the genomic landscape of TC can help clinicians to discover the responsible alterations underlying more advance diseases and to address more tailored therapy. In fact, to date, the antiangiogenic multi-targeted kinase inhibitor (aaMKIs) sorafenib, lenvatinib, and cabozantinib, have been approved for the therapy of aggressive radioiodine (RAI)-resistant papillary TC (PTC) or follicular TC (FTC). Several other compounds, including immunotherapies, have been introduced and, in part, approved for the treatment of TC harboring specific mutations. For example, selpercatinib and pralsetinib inhibit mutant RET in medullary thyroid cancer but they can also block the RET fusion proteins-mediated signaling found in PTC. Entrectinib and larotrectinib, can be used in patients with progressive RAI-resistant TC harboring TRK fusion proteins. In addition FDA authorized the association of dabrafenib (BRAFV600E inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) for the treatment of BRAFV600E-mutated ATC. These drugs not only can limit the cancer spread, but in some circumstance they are able to induce the re-differentiation of aggressive tumors, which can be again submitted to new attempts of RAI therapy. In this review we explore the current knowledge on the genetic landscape of TC and its implication on the development of new precise therapeutic strategies.","author":[{"family":"Elia","given":"Giusy"},{"family":"Patrizio","given":"Armando"},{"family":"Ragusa","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Paparo","given":"Sabrina Rosaria"},{"family":"Mazzi","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Balestri","given":"Eugenia"},{"family":"Botrini","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Rugani","given":"Licia"},{"family":"Benvenga","given":"Salvatore"},{"family":"Materazzi","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Spinelli","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Antonelli","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Fallahi","given":"Poupak"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Silvia Martina"}],"citation-key":"eliaMolecularFeaturesAggressive2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.1099280","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1099280","PMCID":"PMC9807782","PMID":"36605433","source":"PubMed","title":"Molecular features of aggressive thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"else15YEARSPARAGANGLIOMA2015","abstract":"The last decades have elucidated the genetic basis of pheochromocytoma (PC) and paraganglioma (PGL) (PCPGL)-associated hereditary syndromes. However, the history of these syndromes dates back at least another 150 years. Detailed descriptions by clinicians and pathologists in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the recognition of the PCPGL-associated syndromes von Hippel-Lindau disease, neurofibromatosis type 1, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. In the beginning of the current millennium the molecular basis of the hereditary PGL syndrome was elucidated by the discovery of mutations in genes encoding enzymes of the Krebs cycle, such as succinate dehydrogenase genes (SDHx) and other mutations, causing ‘pseudo-hypoxia’ signaling. These recent developments also marked a paradigm shift. It reversed the traditional order of genetic research that historically aimed to define the genetic basis of a known hereditary syndrome but now is challenged with defining the full clinical phenotype associated with a newly defined genetic basis. This challenge underscores the importance to learn from medical history, continue providing support for clinical research, and train physicians with regards to their skills to identify patients with PCPGL-associated syndromes to extend our knowledge of the associated phenotype. This historical overview provides details on the history of the paraganglial system and PCPGL-associated syndromes. As such, it hopefully will not only be an interesting reading for the physician with a historical interest but also emphasize the necessity of ongoing astute individual clinical observations and clinical registries to increase our knowledge regarding the full phenotypic spectrum of these conditions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Else","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"else15YEARSPARAGANGLIOMA2015","container-title":"Endocrine-Related Cancer","DOI":"10.1530/ERC-15-0221","ISSN":"1351-0088, 1479-6821","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",8,1]]},"language":"en_US","page":"T147-T159","publisher":"Bioscientifica Ltd","section":"Endocrine-Related Cancer","source":"erc.bioscientifica.com","title":"15 YEARS OF PARAGANGLIOMA: Pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma and genetic syndromes: a historical perspective","title-short":"15 YEARS OF PARAGANGLIOMA","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://erc.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/erc/22/4/T147.xml","volume":"22"},

Both groups received proton pump inhibitors twice daily. Endoscopic biopsies were acquired at 2 and 12 mo after enrollment, with 4-quadrant biopsies every 1 cm of the original BE extent. A complete histological resolution response of BD (CR-D) was defined as all biopsies at the last endoscopy session negative for BD. Fisher’s exact test was used to assess differences between the two study groups for primary outcomes. For all outcomes, a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance., RESULTS: Thirty (91%) PDT patients and 39 (74%) RFA were men (P = 0.05). The mean age was 70.7 ± 12.2 and 65.4 ± 12.7 (P = 0.10) year and mean length of BE was 5.4 ± 3.2 cm and 5.7 ± 3.2 cm (P = 0.53) for PDT and RFA patients, respectively. The CR-D was (18/33) 54.5% with PDT vs (47/53) 88.7% with RFA (P = 0.001). One patient with PDT had an esophageal perforation and was managed with non-surgical measures and no perforation was seen with RFA. PDT was five times more costly than RFA at our institution. The two groups were not randomized and had different BD grading are the limitations of the study., CONCLUSION: In our experience, RFA had higher rate of CR-D without any serious adverse events and was less costly than PDT for endoscopic treatment of BD.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Ertan","given":"Atilla"},{"family":"Zaheer","given":"Irum"},{"family":"Correa","given":"Arlene M"},{"family":"Thosani","given":"Nirav"},{"family":"Blackmon","given":"Shanda H"}],"citation-key":"ertanPhotodynamicTherapyVs2013","container-title":"World Journal of Gastroenterology : WJG","container-title-short":"World J Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.3748/wjg.v19.i41.7106","ISSN":"1007-9327","issue":"41","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11,7]]},"page":"7106-7113","PMCID":"PMC3819546","PMID":"24222954","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Photodynamic therapy vs radiofrequency ablation for Barrett’s dysplasia: Efficacy, safety and cost-comparison","title-short":"Photodynamic therapy vs radiofrequency ablation for Barrett’s dysplasia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3819546/","volume":"19"},

  {"id":"EsophagealCancer2023","abstract":"Esophageal cancer is cancer arising from the esophagus—the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include difficulty in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, enlarged lymph nodes (\"glands\") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.The two main sub-types of the disease are esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (often abbreviated to ESCC), which is more common in the developing world, and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is more common in the developed world. A number of less common types also occur. Squamous-cell carcinoma arises from the epithelial cells that line the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma arises from glandular cells present in the lower third of the esophagus, often where they have already transformed to intestinal cell type (a condition known as Barrett's esophagus). Causes of the squamous-cell type include tobacco, alcohol, very hot drinks, poor diet, and chewing betel nut. The most common causes of the adenocarcinoma type are smoking tobacco, obesity, and acid reflux.The disease is diagnosed by biopsy done by an endoscope (a fiberoptic camera). Prevention includes stopping smoking and eating a healthy diet. Treatment is based on the cancer's stage and location, together with the person's general condition and individual preferences. Small localized squamous-cell cancers may be treated with surgery alone with the hope of a cure. In most other cases, chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy is used along with surgery. Larger tumors may have their growth slowed with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the presence of extensive disease or if the affected person is not fit enough to undergo surgery, palliative care is often recommended.As of 2018, esophageal cancer was the eighth-most common cancer globally with 572,000 new cases during the year. It caused about 509,000 deaths that year, up from 345,000 in 1990. Rates vary widely among countries, with about half of all cases occurring in China. It is around three times more common in men than in women. Outcomes are related to the extent of the disease and other medical conditions, but generally tend to be fairly poor, as diagnosis is often late. Five-year survival rates are around 13% to 18%.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,3]]},"citation-key":"EsophagealCancer2023","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1167995282","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Esophageal cancer","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esophageal_cancer&oldid=1167995282#Society_and_culture"},

In 1962, the cold agglutinin titer was 1:16,000, and his red cells were coated with complement globulins. In 1966, he developed chronic hemolytic anemia and a macroglobulin M component appeared in the serum protein electrophoresis. The titer of cold agglutinins was 1:64,000. The hemolytic anemia responded to chlorambucil with a decrease in cold agglutinin titer and the level of macroglobulin. Serum complement (C) values returned toward normal. Cessation of chlorambucil was followed by relapse. There was a second response to chlorambucil, but reactivation of the hemolytic anemia occurred following a respiratory infection, despite the reduced titer of cold agglutinin. Chlorambucil was discontinued and has not been administered since. There have been remissions and exacerbations of the hemolytic anemia and a return of the macroglobulin and cold agglutinins toward pretreatment levels. During the past 2 yr there has been spontaneous improvement in his symptoms, and the level of macroglobulin has decreased.

We aimed to assess long-term outcome of this regimen.\n\nMETHODS\n\nFrom 2004 through 2008, we randomly assigned 366 patients to either five weekly cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel with concurrent radiotherapy (41.4 Gy in 23 fractions, 5 days per week) followed by surgery, or surgery alone. Follow-up data were collected through 2018. Cox regression analyses were performed to compare overall survival, cause-specific survival, and risks of locoregional and distant relapse. The effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy beyond 5 years of follow-up was tested with time-dependent Cox regression and landmark analyses.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe median follow-up was 147 months (interquartile range, 134-157). Patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy had better overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.89). The effect of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy on overall survival was not time-dependent (P value for interaction, P = .73), and landmark analyses suggested a stable effect on overall survival up to 10 years of follow-up. The absolute 10-year overall survival benefit was 13% (38% v 25%). Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy reduced risk of death from esophageal cancer (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.80). Death from other causes was similar between study arms (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.99).

  {"id":"fanImprovingCLIPTraining2023","abstract":"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) stands as one of the most effective and scalable methods for training transferable vision models using paired image and text data. CLIP models are trained using contrastive loss, which typically relies on data augmentations to prevent overfitting and shortcuts. However, in the CLIP training paradigm, data augmentations are exclusively applied to image inputs, while language inputs remain unchanged throughout the entire training process, limiting the exposure of diverse texts to the same image. In this paper, we introduce Language augmented CLIP (LaCLIP), a simple yet highly effective approach to enhance CLIP training through language rewrites. Leveraging the in-context learning capability of large language models, we rewrite the text descriptions associated with each image. These rewritten texts exhibit diversity in sentence structure and vocabulary while preserving the original key concepts and meanings. During training, LaCLIP randomly selects either the original texts or the rewritten versions as text augmentations for each image. Extensive experiments on CC3M, CC12M, RedCaps and LAION-400M datasets show that CLIP pre-training with language rewrites significantly improves the transfer performance without computation or memory overhead during training. Specifically for ImageNet zero-shot accuracy, LaCLIP outperforms CLIP by 8.2% on CC12M and 2.4% on LAION-400M.

  {"id":"ferrariNovelApproachesSurgical2021","abstract":"The concept of surgical margins was born a long time ago but still lacks a univocal and sound understanding. The current biological rationale behind the recommendations on margins management relies on two pillars: (1) the observation that groups of cancer cells can leave the macroscopic tumor and disseminate throughout adjacent tissues with different degrees of aggressiveness; (2) the belief that removal of all (or most of) cancer cells can cure the patient. However, this background is undermined by some pieces of evidence. For instance, it has been proven that tissues surrounding cancer often bear precancerous traits, which means that cutting through non-cancerous tissues does not equate to cut through healthy tissues. The head and neck exquisitely poses a number of challenges in the achievement of negative margins, with special reference to anatomical complexity, high density in relevant structures, and unique histological heterogeneity of cancers. Currently, intraoperative margins evaluation relies on surgeons’ sight, palpation, ability to map tumor extension on imaging, and knowledge of anatomy, with some optical imaging technologies aiding the delineation of the mucosal margins of excision. Frozen sections are currently used to intraoperatively evaluate margins, yet with debate on whether and how this practice should be performed. Future perspectives on improvement of margins control are threefold: research is oriented towards refinements of understanding of cancers local progression, implementation of technologies to intraoperatively render tumor extension, and employment of optical imaging modalities capable of detecting foci of residual tumor in the surgical bed.","author":[{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Montalto","given":"Nausica"},{"family":"Nicolai","given":"Piero"}],"citation-key":"ferrariNovelApproachesSurgical2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_7","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

  {"id":"ferrariSlipperyRoleInduction2020","abstract":"Chemoradiotherapy as an alternative to surgery can be offered to patients affected by loco-regionally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC). Induction chemotherapy is a valid option, supported by few positive trials, but its real efficacy is still a matter of debate. The standard regimen for induction chemotherapy in Europe is a combination of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and reduced dose doses of cisplatin (75 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m2 day, for five consecutive days) (TPF). It is less toxic and more effective than the historical therapy PF (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 1,000 mg/m2/day for five consecutive days). However, in some studies treatment-related mortality has been reported to be as high as 6%. Therefore, some less toxic combinations, such as a modified TPF regimen and the combination of carboplatin plus paclitaxel have been studied. These regimens are showing promising results but deserve further validation in comparative trials. Furthermore, several trials are underway in order to enhance TPF with immune checkpoints inhibitors. Compared to chemoradiotherapy, induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation was shown to be non-inferior, and it could decrease the distant metastatic progression, especially in high-risk populations. For selected patients, induction chemotherapy could be a strong option. The chemoselective process that leads to immediate surgery for non-responders, the high response rate (complete responses are sometimes observed), and the survival data, are all arguments in favor of induction chemotherapy, if performed in experienced centers involving health professionals in the context of a skilled multidisciplinary team.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Daris"},{"family":"Ghi","given":"Maria Grazia"},{"family":"Franzese","given":"Ciro"},{"family":"Codecà","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Gau","given":"Max"},{"family":"Fayette","given":"Jerome"}],"citation-key":"ferrariSlipperyRoleInduction2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2020.00007","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1,23]]},"page":"7","PMCID":"PMC6989487","PMID":"32038985","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The Slippery Role of Induction Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer: Myth and Reality","title-short":"The Slippery Role of Induction Chemotherapy in Head and Neck Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6989487/","volume":"10"},

After these tests have been performed, it can be determined whether endoscopic laser therapy (ELT) is the best of the many endoscopic options. There is some difference of opinion as to the specifics of the treatment technique, and these are described. There is general agreement from reviewing the clinical data that it is possible to open the obstructed lumen in a large majority of cases and that functional success (the ability to achieve technically good results as well as clinical improvement without complications) is also possible in the majority of patients.

Treatment consisted of mitomycin C (10 mg/m2 day 1) and continuous infusion 5-FU (1000 mg/m2 day, days 1-4, 29-32) (CT), radiation (XRT) (3000 rad, days 1-21) with nutritional support, and surgery (days 49-64). Surgery consisted of celiotomy, esophagectomy and esophagogastrostomy +/- postoperative ventilatory support. Postoperative CT plus an additional 2000 rad XRT was restricted to patients with histologic positive tumor. Since five resected patients with subclinical metastatic tumor had an inferior survival equal to 25 patients treated essentially for palliation, pretreatment celiotomy seems warranted to identify patients with an inferior prognosis. Of 18 resected patients without disseminated tumor evaluable for this combined modality: six were tumor free, three had intramural and nine transmural tumor; the median survival is 76 weeks and five of six living patients are disease free at 95-190 weeks; and local recurrence occurred in two and in two of seven unresected patients. Since toxicity was minimal except for postoperative pneumonitis (13%) and local recurrence low (13%), two courses of chemotherapy and 5000 rad XRT perhaps obviates the need for resection.","author":[{"family":"Franklin","given":"R."},{"family":"Steiger","given":"Z."},{"family":"Vaishampayan","given":"G."},{"family":"Asfaw","given":"I."},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"J."},{"family":"Loh","given":"J."},{"family":"Hoschner","given":"J."},{"family":"Miller","given":"P."}],"citation-key":"franklinCombinedModalityTherapy1983","container-title":"Cancer","container-title-short":"Cancer","DOI":"10.1002/1097-0142(19830315)51:6<1062::aid-cncr2820510615>3.0.co;2-2","ISSN":"0008-543X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1983",3,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"1062-1071","PMID":"6401596","source":"PubMed","title":"Combined modality therapy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"gaffneySQLitePresentFuture2022","abstract":"In the two decades following its initial release, SQLite has become the most widely deployed database engine in existence. Today, SQLite is found in nearly every smartphone, computer, web browser, television, and automobile. Several factors are likely responsible for its ubiquity, including its in-process design, standalone codebase, extensive test suite, and cross-platform file format. While it supports complex analytical queries, SQLite is primarily designed for fast online transaction processing (OLTP), employing row-oriented execution and a B-tree storage format. However, fueled by the rise of edge computing and data science, there is a growing need for efficient in-process online analytical processing (OLAP). DuckDB, a database engine nicknamed \"the SQLite for analytics\", has recently emerged to meet this demand. While DuckDB has shown strong performance on OLAP benchmarks, it is unclear how SQLite compares. Furthermore, we are aware of no work that attempts to identify root causes for SQLite's performance behavior on OLAP workloads. In this paper, we discuss SQLite in the context of this changing workload landscape. We describe how SQLite evolved from its humble beginnings to the full-featured database engine it is today. We evaluate the performance of modern SQLite on three benchmarks, each representing a different flavor of in-process data management, including transactional, analytical, and blob processing. We delve into analytical data processing on SQLite, identifying key bottlenecks and weighing potential solutions. As a result of our optimizations, SQLite is now up to 4.2X faster on SSB. Finally, we discuss the future of SQLite, envisioning how it will evolve to meet new demands and challenges.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Gaffney","given":"Kevin P."},{"family":"Prammer","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Brasfield","given":"Larry"},{"family":"Hipp","given":"D.

  {"id":"gagliatoClinicalImpactDelaying2014","abstract":"PURPOSE: For patients with breast cancer (BC), the optimal time to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy (TTC) after definitive surgery is unknown. We evaluated the association between TTC and survival according to breast cancer subtype and stage at diagnosis.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Women diagnosed with BC stages I to III between 1997 and 2011 who received adjuvant chemotherapy at our institution were included. Patients were categorized into three groups according to TTC: ≤ 30, 31 to 60, and ≥ 61 days. Survival outcomes were estimated and compared according to TTC and by BC subtype.\nRESULTS: Among the 6,827 patients included, the 5-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and distant RFS (DRFS) estimates were similar for the different TTC categories. Initiation of chemotherapy ≥ 61 days after surgery was associated with adverse outcomes among patients with stage II (DRFS: hazard ratio [HR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.43) and stage III (OS: HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.46; RFS: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.76; and DRFS: HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.80) BC. Patients with triple-negative BC (TNBC) tumors and those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive tumors treated with trastuzumab who started chemotherapy ≥ 61 days after surgery had worse survival (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09 to 2.18 and HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.49 to 6.39, respectively) compared with those who initiated treatment in the first 30 days after surgery.\nCONCLUSION: TTC influenced survival outcomes in the overall study cohort. This finding was particularly meaningful for patients with stage III BC, TNBC, and trastuzumab-treated HER2-positive tumors who experienced worse outcomes when chemotherapy was delayed. Our findings suggest that early initiation of chemotherapy should be granted for patients in these high-risk groups.","author":[{"family":"Gagliato","given":"Debora de Melo"},{"family":"Gonzalez-Angulo","given":"Ana M."},{"family":"Lei","given":"Xiudong"},{"family":"Theriault","given":"Richard L."},{"family":"Giordano","given":"Sharon H."},{"family":"Valero","given":"Vicente"},{"family":"Hortobagyi","given":"Gabriel N."},{"family":"Chavez-Macgregor","given":"Mariana"}],"citation-key":"gagliatoClinicalImpactDelaying2014","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2013.49.7693","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",3,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"735-744","PMCID":"PMC3940536","PMID":"24470007","source":"PubMed","title":"Clinical impact of delaying initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"32"},

This review focuses on the preclinical and clinical evidence of potential predictive biomarkers of response and efficacy of immunotherapy in thyroid neoplasms. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining by immunohistochemistry has shown higher expression in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) compared to other subtypes. The tumor mutational burden in thyroid neoplasms is low but seems to be higher in ATC. Immune infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) differ between the different thyroid neoplasm subtypes. In general, differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) has a higher number of tumor-associated lymphocytes and regulatory T cells (Tregs), while ATC and medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) display a high density of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Nevertheless, results from clinical trials with immunotherapy as monotherapy or combinations have shown limited efficacy. Further investigation into new strategies aside from anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)/programmed death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 antibodies, validation of predictive biomarkers, and better population selection for clinical trials in thyroid neoplasms is more than needed in the near future.","author":[{"family":"Garcia-Alvarez","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"Hernando","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Carmona-Alonso","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Capdevila","given":"Jaume"}],"citation-key":"garcia-alvarezWhatStatusImmunotherapy2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2022.929091","ISSN":"1664-2392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"929091","PMCID":"PMC9389039","PMID":"35992118","source":"PubMed","title":"What is the status of immunotherapy in thyroid neoplasms?","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Presence of two distinct histopathological types distinguishes it from other gastrointestinal tract malignancies. Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment in locally advanced esophageal cancer (T2 or greater or node positive); however, a high rate of disease recurrence (systemic and loco-regional) and poor survival justifies a continued search for optimal therapy. Various combinations of multimodality treatment (preoperative/perioperative, or postoperative; radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy) are being explored to lower disease recurrence and improve survival. Preoperative therapy followed by surgery is presently considered the standard of care in resectable locally advanced esophageal cancer as postoperative treatment may not be feasible for all the patients due to the morbidity of esophagectomy and prolonged recovery time limiting the tolerance of patient. There are wide variations in the preoperative therapy practiced across the centres depending upon the institutional practices, availability of facilities and personal experiences. There is paucity of literature to standardize the preoperative therapy. Broadly, chemoradiotherapy is the preferred neo-adjuvant modality in western countries whereas chemotherapy alone is considered optimal in the far East.

However, response rates vary, and these treatments have a high rate of immune-related side effects, which can be limiting. Thus, tests to predict who will respond and who may experience side effects are of critical importance toward realizing the ultimate goal of precision oncology.\nAREAS COVERED: We review several of the most recent advances in circulating biomarkers that have been reported to be useful in predicting response and immune-related adverse events (irAE) to checkpoint blockade immunotherapies (CBI). We focus on high-quality studies published within the last few years. We highlight significant findings, identify areas for improvement, and provide recommendations on how these biomarkers may be translated into clinical utility.\nEXPERT OPINION: As newer immunotherapies are developed, there is a pressing need to identify circulating biomarkers that can help predict responses and side effects. Current studies are mostly small-scale and retrospective; there is a need for larger-scale and prospective studies to help validate several of the biomarkers detailed here. As oncology focuses more on precision-based approaches, it is likely that a combination of biomarkers, including circulating ones as detailed here, will have critical utility in guiding clinical decisions.","author":[{"family":"Garrison","given":"Zachary"},{"family":"Hornick","given":"Noah"},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"Kulkarni","given":"Rajan P."}],"citation-key":"garrisonCirculatingBiomarkersResponse2022","container-title":"Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics","container-title-short":"Expert Rev Mol Diagn","DOI":"10.1080/14737159.2022.2130688","ISSN":"1744-8352","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"855-865","PMID":"36193802","source":"PubMed","title":"Circulating biomarkers of response to immunotherapy and immune-related adverse events","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

However, systematic evaluations of these studies are lacking.To provide state-of-the-art evidence and normative theoretical support for neoadjuvant immunotherapy for locally advanced resectable esophageal cancer.PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for relevant original articles and conference proceedings that were published in English through April 1, 2022.Published phase 2 or 3 clinical trials that included patients with resectable stage I to IV esophageal cancer who received immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) before surgery as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies.The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses and the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for meta-analysis were followed to extract data. A random-effects model was adopted if the heterogeneity was significant (I2 statistic &gt;50%); otherwise, the common-effects model was used. Data analyses were conducted from April 2 to 8, 2022.Pathological complete response (pCR) rate and major pathological response (MPR) rate were considered to be the primary outcomes calculated for the clinical outcomes of neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Incidence of treatment-related severe adverse events was set as the major measure for the safety outcome. The rate of R0 surgical resection was summarized. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to histologic subtype and ICI types.A total of 27 clinical trials with 815 patients were included. Pooled rates were 31.4% (95% CI, 27.6%-35.3%) for pCR and 48.9% (95% CI, 42.0-55.9%) for MCR in patients with esophageal cancer. In terms of safety, the pooled incidence of treatment-related severe adverse events was 26.9% (95% CI, 16.7%-38.3%). Most patients achieved R0 surgical resection (98.6%; 95% CI, 97.1%-99.6%).

Additional literature was obtained from original papers and published meeting abstracts.\nRESULTS: Forty-six non-randomized and six randomized trials of preoperative CRT were found. Resection rates, pathological complete response (pCR), treatment-related mortality rates and relapse patterns are documented. Improved 5-year survival rates approaching 60 per cent may be achieved following pCR. Three of the six randomized trials show a benefit in either overall survival or disease-free survival compared with surgery alone. Treatment-related toxicity can be significant.\nCONCLUSION: Preoperative CRT may improve survival. Emerging evidence suggests that CRT alone can achieve similar survival rates to surgery alone. New imaging modalities may help to select which patients require surgery. Larger randomized trials of preoperative CRT or chemotherapy are needed to define optimal regimens and produce higher pCR rates with acceptable toxicity.","author":[{"family":"Geh","given":"J.

Cold-induced binding of autoantibody agglutinates red blood cells and triggers the classical complement pathway, leading to predominantly extravascular hemolysis.\nAREAS COVERED: This review summarizes clinical and experimental antibody-based treatments for CAD and analyzes the risks and benefits of B cell and complement directed therapies, and discusses potential future treatments for CAD.\nEXPERT OPINION: Conventional treatment of CAD includes a B cell targeted treatment approach with rituximab, yielding only limited treatment success. The addition of a cytotoxic agent (e.g. bendamustine) increases efficacy, but this is accompanied by an increased risk of neutropenia and infection. Novel complement directed therapies have emerged and were shown to have good efficacy against hemolysis and safety profiles but are expensive and unable to address circulatory symptoms. Complement inhibition with sutimlimab may be used as a bridging strategy until B cell directed therapy with rituximab takes effect or continued indefinitely if needed. Future antibody-based treatment approaches for CAD involve the further development of complement directed antibodies, a combination of rituximab and bortezomib, and daratumumab. Non-antibody based prospective treatments may include the use of Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","author":[{"family":"Gelbenegger","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Berentsen","given":"Sigbjørn"},{"family":"Jilma","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"gelbeneggerMonoclonalAntibodiesTreatment2023","container-title":"Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy","container-title-short":"Expert Opin Biol Ther","DOI":"10.1080/14712598.2023.2209265","ISSN":"1744-7682","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"395-406","PMID":"37128907","source":"PubMed","title":"Monoclonal antibodies for treatment of cold agglutinin disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},
  {"id":"gertzUpdatesDiagnosisManagement2022","abstract":"Cold agglutinin disease represents a form of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia whereby an IgM protein either monoclonal or polyclonal deposits complement on the surface of the red blood cell. Once complement is deposited, the 3rd component of complement is recognized by receptors in the mononuclear phagocyte system resulting in spherocytic extravascular hemolysis. This results in a Coombs positive hemolytic anemia with the peripheral blood film showing agglutination. In many instances, the source is a clonal population of lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow producing a monoclonal IgM protein. Traditional and emerging therapies directed against the production of the IgM may have a positive effect on hemolytic anemia. Success in the management of cold agglutinin disease with rituximab, fludarabine, bortezomib, and bendamustine has all been reported. Recent studies have demonstrated that the blockade of complement with sutimlimab can stop the hemolysis without the use of systemic chemotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Gertz","given":"Morie A."}],"citation-key":"gertzUpdatesDiagnosisManagement2022","container-title":"Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America","container-title-short":"Hematol Oncol Clin North Am","DOI":"10.1016/j.hoc.2021.11.001","ISSN":"1558-1977","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"341-352","PMCID":"PMC9088174","PMID":"35282954","source":"PubMed","title":"Updates on the Diagnosis and Management of Cold Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},

Arterial thromboembolism, including myocardial infarction and stroke, is also prevalent. Risk differs in subgroups, with higher rates observed in specific cancers including pancreas, stomach, and multiple myeloma. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended for most patients with active cancer hospitalized for medical illnesses and after major cancer surgery. Outpatient thromboprophylaxis is not routinely recommended, but emerging data suggest that a high-risk population that benefits from pharmacological thromboprophylaxis can be identified using a validated risk tool. Direct oral anticoagulants are emerging as the preferred new option for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE, although low-molecular-weight heparin remains a standard for patients at high bleeding risk.

  {"id":"ghosseinImmunohistochemicalDetectionMutated2013","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The mutated BRAF V600E protein has been specifically detected in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) using immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. The clonal origin of PTCs harboring BRAF mutations has recently been called into question.\nOBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was 2-fold: (1) to compare BRAF V600E IHC expression in PTCs, poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas (PDTCs), and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATCs) with DNA mutation analysis; and (2) to study the distribution of BRAF V600E IHC staining within thyroid cancer tissues.\nMETHODS: Whole sections and tissue microarrays from 31 PTCs, 38 PDTCs, and 22 ATCs were subjected to both mass spectrometry genotyping for the BRAF(T1799A) mutation as well as IHC staining for BRAF V600E protein.\nRESULTS: Of the 31 PTCs, 16 (52%) showed strong (3+) IHC staining and harbored BRAF(T1799A), whereas the remaining 15 (48%) showed absent/faint (0/1+) staining, and were wild type for BRAF (BRAF-wt). Only 5 of 38 (13%) PDTCs harbored mutant BRAF, and these were the only ones with moderate (2+) or 3+ IHC staining. All 14 ATCs with a staining intensity of 3+ harbored BRAF(T1799A), whereas the 2 ATCs with 0/1+ staining were BRAF-wt. Six ATCs showed staining of 2+, 5 of which had high background staining. Of those 6 cases, BRAF(T1799A) was present only in the tumor without background. Homogeneous staining was found in 13 of 14 (93%) PTCs, 3 of 3 (100%) PDTCs, and 12 of 14 ATCs (86%).\nCONCLUSIONS: First, absent/faint staining for BRAF V600E correlates perfectly with the lack of the BRAF(T1799A) mutation, whereas strong staining is highly specific for the BRAF(T1799A) mutation in PTCs, PDTCs, and ATCs. Moderate staining intensity cannot be relied on and should lead to genotypic analysis. Second, homogeneous staining occurs in the vast majority of cases, demonstrating that the BRAF(T1799A) mutation is a clonal event in thyroid cancer.","author":[{"family":"Ghossein","given":"Ronald A."},{"family":"Katabi","given":"Nora"},{"family":"Fagin","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"ghosseinImmunohistochemicalDetectionMutated2013","container-title":"The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism","container-title-short":"J Clin Endocrinol Metab","DOI":"10.1210/jc.2013-1408","ISSN":"1945-7197","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"E1414-1421","PMCID":"PMC6287446","PMID":"23775351","source":"PubMed","title":"Immunohistochemical detection of mutated BRAF V600E supports the clonal origin of BRAF-induced thyroid cancers along the spectrum of disease progression","type":"article-journal","volume":"98"},

In addition, alterations of c-KIT, NF1, TERT, chemokine receptors as well as chromosomal copy number alterations and micro RNAs are thought to have a causative association with CM development. Targeted molecular inhibitors, such as BRAF and MEK inhibitors, are currently being implemented in the therapy of BRAF-mutated CM. Furthermore, immune checkpoint PD-1 and CTLA4 inhibitors with favorable clinical outcomes in the treatment of cutaneous melanoma have increased recurrence-free survival and reduced metastatic spread in CM cases.\n\nConclusion\nThe complex molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of CM can be targeted both by molecular inhibitors of oncogenic pathways as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors in order to halt progression of the disease and increase survival.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Gkiala","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Palioura","given":"Sotiria"}],"citation-key":"gkialaConjunctivalMelanomaUpdate2020","container-title":"Clinical Ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)","container-title-short":"Clin Ophthalmol","DOI":"10.2147/OPTH.S271569","ISSN":"1177-5467","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,9]]},"page":"3137-3152","PMCID":"PMC7553763","PMID":"33116365","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Conjunctival Melanoma: Update on Genetics, Epigenetics and Targeted Molecular and Immune-Based Therapies","title-short":"Conjunctival Melanoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553763/","volume":"14"},

This article reviews existing scraping frameworks and tools, identifying their strengths and limitations in terms of extraction capabilities. The main focus is set on showing how straightforward it is today to set up a data scraping pipeline, with minimal programming effort, and answer a number of practical needs.

  {"id":"gomez-deleonContributionsAmericanSociety2021","abstract":"PURPOSE: Establishing research capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is key for improving the outcomes of patients with hematologic diseases globally. Few studies have analyzed the contributions of LMICs to global hematology. The American Society of Hematology Meeting (ASH) is the largest international academic event where peer-reviewed contributions in our field are presented.\nMETHODS: In this cross-sectional analysis, all abstracts accepted to ASH 2018 selected for a poster or oral presentation were reviewed. Those that had a contributing author from an LMIC were identified. The proportion of LMIC abstracts across categories was analyzed. Country of origin, high-income country participation, the presence of a conflict of interest (COI), and sponsorship were determined.\nRESULTS: From 4,871 abstracts reviewed, 506 had a contributing author from an LMIC (10.4%), with 277 (54.7%) contributions in partnership with a high-income country. LMIC-independent contributions corresponded to 19 of 1,026 oral abstracts (1.9%) and 209 of 3,845 posters (5.4%). Most abstracts from LMICs were clinical (n = 311; 61.5%) and multicentric in nature (n = 353; 69.8%). COI statements with the pharmaceutical industry were common (n = 214; 42.3%).

Upper-middle-income countries had 466 participations (81.5%), in comparison with 96 (16.8%) in low-middle-income and 10 (1.7%) in low-income countries.\nCONCLUSION: LMICs were responsible for a small fraction of abstracts at ASH18; low-income countries were practically absent. Almost half of accepted works represented a form of international collaboration, with clinical, multicenter studies predominating and COI disclosures a frequent and unexpected feature, reflecting the instrumental nature of LMIC participation and a lack of independent, robust, locally developed hematology research.","author":[{"family":"Gómez-De León","given":"Andrés"},{"family":"Colunga-Pedraza","given":"Perla R."},{"family":"Tarín-Arzaga","given":"Luz"},{"family":"Bugarín-Estrada","given":"Emmanuel"},{"family":"Sung","given":"Lilian"},{"family":"Cantú-Martínez","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Jaime-Pérez","given":"José C."},{"family":"Gómez-Almaguer","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"gomez-deleonContributionsAmericanSociety2021","container-title":"JCO global oncology","container-title-short":"JCO Glob Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/GO.20.00600","ISSN":"2687-8941","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"622-631","PMCID":"PMC8162961","PMID":"33909458","source":"PubMed","title":"Contributions to the American Society of Hematology Meeting From Low- and Middle-Income Countries: An In-Depth Analysis and Call to Action","title-short":"Contributions to the American Society of Hematology Meeting From Low- and Middle-Income Countries","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

Multiple statistically weighted clinical features were used to generate a prognostic categorization model. Bone marrow cytogenetics, marrow blast percentage, and cytopenias remained the basis of the new system. Novel components of the current analysis included: 5 rather than 3 cytogenetic prognostic subgroups with specific and new classifications of a number of less common cytogenetic subsets, splitting the low marrow blast percentage value, and depth of cytopenias. This model defined 5 rather than the 4 major prognostic categories that are present in the IPSS. Patient age, performance status, serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase were significant additive features for survival but not for acute myeloid leukemia transformation. This system comprehensively integrated the numerous known clinical features into a method analyzing MDS patient prognosis more precisely than the initial IPSS.

  {"id":"greensteinEffectLocalTherapy2008","abstract":"Surgical resection is the current standard treatment for patients with early stage cancer of the esophagus. In a subset of these patients, comorbidities prohibit the operative risks of a potentially curative esophagectomy. Such patients may be candidates for local endoscopic treatment. We sought to look at a large cohort of patients with clinically localized esophagus cancer to determine whether high-risk patients survive significantly longer after endoscopic therapy than those who receive no local treatment. T0 or T1, N0 esophageal cancer (EC) patients who did not receive surgery or radiation were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry (1998-2003). The patients were assigned into two groups: local endoscopic therapy (excisional biopsy, photodynamic, local destruction, thermal laser, polypectomy, electrocautery, or cryoablation) versus no endoscopic therapy. Differences in survival were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders was used to analyze the effect of local therapy on survival. The study cohort included 166 T0 or T1, N0 EC patients. (75% male; 50% >70 years old). Tumors were adenocarcinoma (60%), squamous cell carcinoma (24%), and other (16%). The 4-year disease-specific survival rate was 84% for patients receiving local therapy compared with 64% for patients receiving no therapy (P < 0.01). On multivariate analysis, patients receiving local therapy had a significantly lower hazard of EC-related death (P = 0.04). There was no difference in survival curves for deaths secondary to causes other than EC.

We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for ESCC based on a cohort study for the population.\nMETHODS: Data of 115,686 participants were collected from esophageal cancer (EC) early diagnosis and treatment of cancer program as derivation cohort while data of 54,750 participants were collected as validation cohort. Risk factors considered included age, sex, smoking status, alcohol drinking status, body mass index (BMI), tea drinking status, marital status, annual household income, source of drinking water, education level, and diet habit. Cox proportional hazards model was used to develop ESCC prediction model at 5 years. Calibration ability, discrimination ability, and decision curve analysis were analyzed in both derivation and validation cohort. A score model was developed based on prediction model.\nRESULTS: One hundred eighty-six cases were diagnosed during 556,949.40 person-years follow-up in the derivation cohort while 120 cases from 277,302.70 in the validation cohort. Prediction model included the following variables: age, sex, alcohol drinking status, BMI, tea drinking status, and fresh fruit. The model had good discrimination and calibration performance: R 2, D statistic, and Harrell's C statistic of prediction model were 43.56%, 1.70, and 0.798 in derivation cohort and 45.19%, 1.62, and 0.787 in validation cohort. The calibration analysis showed good coherence between predicted probabilities and observed probabilities while decision curve analysis showed clinical usefulness. The score model was as follows: age (3 for 45-49 years old; 4 for 50-54 years old; 7 for 55-59 years old; 9 for 60-64 years; 10 for 65-69 years), sex (5 for men), BMI (1 for ≤25), alcohol drinking status (2 for alcohol drinkers), tea drinking status (2 for tea drinkers), and fresh fruit (2 for never) and showed good discrimination ability with area under the curve and its 95% confidence interval of 0.792 (0.761,0.822) in the deviation cohort and 0.773 (0.736,0.811) in the validation cohort.

  {"id":"hanPredictiveValueSystemic2023","abstract":"ObjectivesNeoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (nICT) has been confirmed with promising pathological complete response (pCR) among locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, there were still no reliable and accurate predictors to predict the treatment response. This study aimed to explore the predictive value of inflammatory and nutritional parameters.MethodsPatients with ESCC who underwent radical surgery after nICT between January 2020 and April 2022 were included in the study. First, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) logistic regression analysis was used to screen independent inflammatory and nutritional parameters. Secondly, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to screen and predict independent risk factors for pCR. Thirdly, a nomogram was constructed based on the independent predictive factors, and 30% of the included population was randomly selected as the validation cohort. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curve to evaluate the nomogram model.ResultsA total of 97 ESCC patients were screened for analysis, with 20 patients with pCR (20.32%). Only the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) was screened after LASSO-logistic regression when λ was 0.06. The cut-off value of SII was 921.80 with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.62. We defined SII > 921.80 as high SII and SII ≦ 921.80 as low SII. Further, the univariate and multivariate analysis further determined SII(OR = 3.94, 95%CI:1.26–12.42, P = 0.02) and clinical stage(OR = 0.35, 95%CI:0.12–0.98, P = 0.05) were independent predictive factors of pCR. One novel nomogram was established with an AUC value of 0.72 in the training cohort and 0.82 in the validation cohort. The Brier score of the calibration curve was 0.13. The calibration curve showed good agreement between the predicted results and the actual results in both the training cohort and the validation cohort. Compared with the clinical stage, the DCA confirmed a better clinical value of the nomogram model in both the training cohort and the validation cohort.ConclusionsHigh pretreatment SII and early clinical stage were independently associated with pCR among ESCC receiving nICT. We further established and validated one novel nomogram model to effectively predict pCR among ESCC after nICT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Han","given":"Wu"},{"family":"Weng","given":"Kai"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Peipei"},{"family":"Hong","given":"Zhinuan"}],"citation-key":"hanPredictiveValueSystemic2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Surgery","ISSN":"2296-875X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Predictive value of systemic immune-inflammation index for pathological complete response in patients receiving neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2022.1091601","volume":"9"},

We developed a thermal endoscope using an ultra-compact thermo-sensor and established a new laparoscopic laser thermal therapy system to heat cancer tissue at an appropriate temperature, focusing on the fact that thermographic cameras are capable of two-dimensional temperature mapping. Hepatocellular carcinoma (N1S1) cells were implanted into the livers of Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 13) to create orthotopic hepatocellular carcinoma. Six of the rats underwent laparoscopic laser thermotherapy (70 °C, 5 min) using the newly developed system, and the others underwent laparoscopic insertion only. Lesion volume measurement and histological evaluation were performed in all of the rats. The laparoscopic laser thermal therapy system provided stable temperature control. When a temperature of 70 °C was used for the set temperature, the temperature of the target cancer was maintained within the range of 68–72 °C for 93.2% of the irradiation time (5 min). The median volume of the tumors that were thermally treated was significantly smaller than that of the untreated tumors. The newly developed laparoscopic laser thermal therapy system was capable of maintaining the temperature of the tumor surface at any desired temperature and was proven to be effective in treatment of the rat hepatocellular carcinoma model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Harada","given":"Manabu"},{"family":"Morimoto","given":"Yuji"},{"family":"Mutsuki","given":"Ohara"},{"family":"Ohya","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Masamune","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Itazaki","given":"Yujiro"},{"family":"Sugihara","given":"Takao"},{"family":"Tsujimoto","given":"Hironori"},{"family":"Kishi","given":"Yoji"},{"family":"Ueno","given":"Hideki"}],"citation-key":"haradaTemperaturecontrolledLaserThermal2022","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-022-22908-4","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10,31]]},"language":"en","page":"18287","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Temperature-controlled laser thermal therapy system using a newly developed laparoscopic system equipped with an ultra-compact thermographic camera","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-22908-4","volume":"12"},
  {"id":"harahapAssociationProgrammedDeathLigand2022","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Immunohistochemical expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) has become a biomarker to predict the usefulness of cancer immunotherapy using PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in a variety of advanced-stage tumours. This emerging biomarker may serve to generate novel therapies for aggressive thyroid carcinoma (TC), which has not shown optimal results with existing treatments.\nMETHODS: The present study investigated the relevance of PD-L1 expression in aggressive histological types of TC compared with that found in less aggressive types. Surgically resected specimens were investigated, including 52 cases of TC consisting of 26 cases of aggressive histological types and 26 cases of less aggressive histological types. Immunohistochemical examinations were carried out on paraffin blocks of both groups using a mouse monoclonal primary antibody against PD-L1 (clone 22C3). PD-L1 expression was evaluated by calculating the tumour proportion score (TPS) in both groups.\nRESULTS: The results revealed a significant difference in the median TPS value of PD-L1 expression between the two groups. The TPS values were found to be higher in the group of aggressive histological types of TC compared with those in the group of less aggressive histological types. A significant difference in TPS value was also found for the extrathyroidal extension variable.\nDISCUSSION: In conclusion, the present study found a significant association between PD-L1 expression and the aggressive histological type of TC. In addition, a potential association between PD-L1 expression and the presence of extrathyroidal extension of TC was observed. These findings provide novel approaches for immunotherapy as a potential new treatment modality in patients with aggressive histological types of TC.","author":[{"family":"Harahap","given":"Agnes Stephanie"},{"family":"Lay","given":"Fanny Kamarudy"},{"family":"Kodariah","given":"Ria"},{"family":"Wongkar","given":"Fresia Juwitasari"},{"family":"Ham","given":"Maria Francisca"}],"citation-key":"harahapAssociationProgrammedDeathLigand2022","container-title":"Cancer Management and Research","container-title-short":"Cancer Manag Res","DOI":"10.2147/CMAR.S392475","ISSN":"1179-1322","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"3539-3550","PMCID":"PMC9793731","PMID":"36583030","source":"PubMed","title":"Association of Programmed Death-Ligand 1 Expression with Aggressive Histological Types of Thyroid Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

Loco-regional recurrence and/or metastatic relapse after intensive local therapies remain the scourge of those who suffer from this disease, and the surgeons and physicians who treat them. Regrettably, until now, we have failed to develop effective adjuvant therapies that can be delivered after the completion of definitive loco-regional treatment in order to reduce the risk of disease relapse. In this chapter, approaches based on cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted therapies directed against c-erbB/HER receptors and immune checkpoint inhibition will be discussed. Neither cytotoxic chemotherapy nor anti-HER-family targeted therapies have proven to be successful as adjuvant therapies for locoregionally-advanced head and neck cancers, but there is significant hope that anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1-targeted antibody therapies may deliver progress in this area for the first time.","author":[{"family":"Harrington","given":"Kevin J."}],"citation-key":"harringtonThereRoleAdjuvant2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_14","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

However, the type of primary therapy and role of radiotherapy (RT) remains ill-defined. Herein, we evaluated the outcome of PMBCL primarily treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) and the impact of an end-of-treatment (EOT) 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) scan to guide consolidative RT. Patients ≥18 years of age with PMBCL treated with curative intent rituximab-chemotherapy were identified. Prior to 2005, patients were recommended to receive R-CHOP + RT (RT era). Beginning in 2005, EOT PET was used to guide RT and only those with a PET-positive scan received RT (PET era). In total, 159 patients were identified, 94% were treated with R-CHOP and 44% received RT (78% in RT era, 28% in PET era). The 5-year time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort were 80% and 89%, respectively, similar across treatment eras. Overall, 10% had refractory disease. In total, 113 patients had an EOT PET scan: 63% negative and 37% positive with a 5-year TTP of 90% vs 71% and 5-year OS of 97% vs 88%, respectively. For those with Deauville (D)-scored PET scans (n = 103), the 5-year TTP for PET-negative cases by Deauville criteria (D1-D3, DX) was 91%, with inferior outcomes for D5 vs D4 (5-year TTP 33% vs 87%, P = .0002). Outcomes for PMBCL treated with RCHOP are favorable and use of a PET-adapted approach reduces RT in the majority of patients.

  {"id":"hendrenPatientsBarriersReceipt2011","abstract":"Background\nRacial minorities have poorer cancer survival in the United States. The purpose of this study was to better understand patients’ barriers to cancer care, and to determine which patients have a greater need for assistance from a patient navigator.\n\nMethods\nCommunity health workers assisted newly-diagnosed breast and colorectal cancer patients during a randomized trial of patient navigation, and collected information about patients’ barriers. Barriers to care were characterized, and were compared between non-Hispanic white and minority patients. A multivariate model was constructed of factors associated with increased log Navigation Time, a measure of patients’ need for assistance.\n\nResults\nPatients’ (n=103) most commonly-identified barriers to care included a lack of social support, insurance/financial concerns, and problems communicating with healthcare providers. Barriers differed between non-minority and minority patients, and minority patients faced a greater number of barriers (p=0.0001). In univariate analysis, log Navigation Time was associated with race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, insurance type, health literacy, marital status, language, and comorbidity. A multivariate model (R2=0.43) for log Navigation Time was created using stepwise selection, and included the following factors: minority race/ethnicity (p=0.032), non-full-time employment (p=0.0004), unmarried status (p=0.085), university center (0.0005), and months in study (p<0.0001).\n\nConclusions\nNewly-diagnosed cancer patients’ most common barriers to care include lack of social support, insurance/financial concerns, and problems with healthcare communications. In this sample of patients, a greater need for assistance was independently associated with minority race/ethnicity and unemployment.

  {"id":"henleyInvasiveCancerIncidence2017","abstract":"PROBLEM/CONDITION: Previous reports have shown that persons living in nonmetropolitan (rural or urban) areas in the United States have higher death rates from all cancers combined than persons living in metropolitan areas. Disparities might vary by cancer type and between occurrence and death from the disease. This report provides a comprehensive assessment of cancer incidence and deaths by cancer type in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties.\nREPORTING PERIOD: 2004-2015.\nDESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: Cancer incidence data from CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program were used to calculate average annual age-adjusted incidence rates for 2009-2013 and trends in annual age-adjusted incidence rates for 2004-2013. Cancer mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System were used to calculate average annual age-adjusted death rates for 2011-2015 and trends in annual age-adjusted death rates for 2006-2015. For 5-year average annual rates, counties were classified into four categories (nonmetropolitan rural, nonmetropolitan urban, metropolitan with population <1 million, and metropolitan with population ≥1 million). For the trend analysis, which used annual rates, these categories were combined into two categories (nonmetropolitan and metropolitan). Rates by county classification were examined by sex, age, race/ethnicity, U.S. census region, and cancer site. Trends in rates were examined by county classification and cancer site.\nRESULTS: During the most recent 5-year period for which data were available, nonmetropolitan rural areas had lower average annual age-adjusted cancer incidence rates for all anatomic cancer sites combined but higher death rates than metropolitan areas. During 2006-2015, the annual age-adjusted death rates for all cancer sites combined decreased at a slower pace in nonmetropolitan areas (-1.0% per year) than in metropolitan areas (-1.6% per year), increasing the differences in these rates. In contrast, annual age-adjusted incidence rates for all cancer sites combined decreased approximately 1% per year during 2004-2013 both in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties.\nINTERPRETATION: This report provides the first comprehensive description of cancer incidence and mortality in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties in the United States. Nonmetropolitan rural counties had higher incidence of and deaths from several cancers related to tobacco use and cancers that can be prevented by screening. Differences between nonmetropolitan and metropolitan counties in cancer incidence might reflect differences in risk factors such as cigarette smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity, whereas differences in cancer death rates might reflect disparities in access to health care and timely diagnosis and treatment.\nPUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Many cancer cases and deaths could be prevented, and public health programs can use evidence-based strategies from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) to support cancer prevention and control. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends population-based screening for colorectal, female breast, and cervical cancers among adults at average risk for these cancers and for lung cancer among adults at high risk; screening adults for tobacco use and excessive alcohol use, offering counseling and interventions as needed; and using low-dose aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer among adults considered to be at high risk for cardiovascular disease based on specific criteria. ACIP recommends vaccination against cancer-related infectious diseases including human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus. The Guide to Community Preventive Services describes program and policy interventions proven to increase cancer screening and vaccination rates and to prevent tobacco use, excessive alcohol use, obesity, and physical inactivity.","author":[{"family":"Henley","given":"S.

  {"id":"herskovicCombinedChemotherapyRadiotherapy1992","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The efficacy of conventional treatment with surgery and radiation for cancer of the esophagus is limited. The median survival is less than 10 months, and less than 10 percent of patients survive for 5 years. Recent studies have suggested that combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy may result in improved survival.\nMETHODS: This phase III prospective, randomized, and stratified trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of four courses of combined fluorouracil (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area daily for four days) and cisplatin (75 mg per square meter on the first day) plus 5000 cGy of radiation therapy, as compared with 6400 cGy of radiation therapy alone, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma of the thoracic esophagus. The trial was stopped after the accumulated results in 121 patients demonstrated a significant advantage for survival in the patients who received chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\nRESULTS: The median survival was 8.9 months in the radiation-treated patients, as compared with 12.5 months in the patients treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In the former group, the survival rates at 12 and 24 months were 33 percent and 10 percent, respectively, whereas they were 50 percent and 38 percent in the patients receiving combined therapy (P less than 0.001). Seven patients in the radiotherapy group and 25 in the combined-therapy group were alive at the time of the analysis. The patients who received combined treatment had fewer local (P less than 0.02) and fewer distant (P less than 0.01) recurrences. Severe and life-threatening side effects occurred in 44 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of the patients who received combined therapy, as compared with 25 percent and 3 percent of those treated with radiation alone.\nCONCLUSIONS: Concurrent therapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil and radiation is superior to radiation therapy alone in patients with localized carcinoma of the esophagus, as measured by control of local tumors, distant metastases, and survival, but at the cost of increased side effects.","author":[{"family":"Herskovic","given":"A."},{"family":"Martz","given":"K."},{"family":"Sarraf","given":"M.","non-dropping-particle":"al-"},{"family":"Leichman","given":"L."},{"family":"Brindle","given":"J."},{"family":"Vaitkevicius","given":"V."},{"family":"Cooper","given":"J."},{"family":"Byhardt","given":"R."},{"family":"Davis","given":"L."},{"family":"Emami","given":"B."}],"citation-key":"herskovicCombinedChemotherapyRadiotherapy1992","container-title":"The New England Journal of Medicine","container-title-short":"N Engl J Med","DOI":"10.1056/NEJM199206113262403","ISSN":"0028-4793","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["1992",6,11]]},"language":"eng","page":"1593-1598","PMID":"1584260","source":"PubMed","title":"Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with cancer of the esophagus","type":"article-journal","volume":"326"},
  {"id":"herskovicEsophagealCarcinomaAdvances2012","abstract":"The treatment results of patients with locally advanced esophageal carcinomas have evolved since the publication of the first trial of concurrent mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil with radiotherapy (RT) in 1983. Subsequent studies refined and improved on the concurrent chemotherapy (chemo) with administration of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil infusion (PF). Chemo (PF) before surgery improved overall survival (OS) in those patients in most of the randomized trials and in meta-analyses. Two courses of PF concurrent with irradiation followed by additional two courses of PF were superior to RT alone without surgery for both groups. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery was found to have statistically improved OS as compared with surgery only in randomized trials and meta-analyses. In most of these studies, it was found that those patients with pathologic complete response to the initial treatment(s) did better than those who had no improvement at all. Current treatment outcome for these diseases is disappointing; newer strategies including induction chemo with the optimal combination, proper dosage of each drug, and proper number of courses before concurrent chemoradiotherapy; improvement in RT; and immunotherapy with or without subsequent surgery are exciting and definitely need to be investigated in prospective randomized trial(s).","author":[{"family":"Herskovic","given":"A."},{"family":"Russell","given":"W."},{"family":"Liptay","given":"M."},{"family":"Fidler","given":"M.

Main characteristics of patients with MPP were: primary pheochromocytoma in 53% of patients; tumor- or hormone-related symptoms in 57% or 58% of cases; positive plasma or urine hormones in 81% of patients; identification of a mutation in SDHB in 42% of cases. Metastatic sites included bone (64%), lymph node (40%), lung (29%), and liver (26%); mean time between initial and malignancy diagnosis was 43 months (range, 0 to 614). Median follow-up was 68 months and median survival 6.7 years. Using univariate analysis, better survival was associated with head and neck paraganglioma, age &lt;40 years, metanephrines less than fivefold the upper limits of the normal range, and low proliferative index. In multivariate analysis, hypersecretion [hazard ratio 3.02 (1.65 to 5.55); P = 0.0004] was identified as an independent significant prognostic factor of worst OS.Our results do not confirm SDHB mutations as a major prognostic parameter in MPP and suggest additional key molecular events involved in MPP tumor progression.

  {"id":"hiltonEquivalentCircuitModeling2011","abstract":"The udu drum is both an aerophone and an idiophone played with both of the musician's hands. It originates from Nigeria where it began as a functional water pot made out of fired clay. At some point, a side hole was cut into the pot and it became a musical instrument, traditionally played by women, which had an important role in religious ceremonies. The udu is capable of producing deep tones that result from acoustic resonances similar to those of Helmholtz resonators, though with a second hole. It also may produce higher pitch sounds that result from the musician tapping the surface of the udu. This paper will discuss one-dimensional equivalent circuit modeling of the acoustic resonances of the udu. A comparison of the resonance frequencies in the equivalent circuit modeling to measured resonance frequencies will be given. Additionally, an analysis of the structural modes of the udu as measured by a scanning laser vibrometer will be given, along with some insights into the sound produced by striking the drum at different locations. This information may be used by udu designers to better tune these instruments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",7,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Hilton","given":"C.

  {"id":"hiltonPedagogyNationalismComplex2013","abstract":"Early after the occupation of Tibet, India provided land and protection for the\nTibetan refugees. Today India is dotted with Tibetan settlements, nearly\nhomogenous towns of a few hundred to twenty thousand Tibetans.

Folk music and dance is an integral part of the\ncurriculum, taught throughout the entire K - 12 education. Drawing from\nexperience receiving instruction and assisting in the music classroom, I\ndiscuss the interplay of musical pedagogy, Tibetan and Indian nationalism,\nand the production and preservation of identity in the Tibetan diaspora.\nTaking after Diehl (2002), I consider the various influences on the refugee in\nIndia and negotiate the constant interplay of Western, Indian, Tibetan, and\nChinese forces on Tibetan refugee musics. Unique to my experience was an\ninjunction from the foremost ambassador of traditional Tibetan music,\nTechung, to not only act as an ethnomusicologist in participant-observation\nbut also as a corrective to Bylakuppean views of Western music. To this end I\nworked closely with my music teachers, both graduates of the Tibetan\nInstitute of Performing Arts, to oversee the hybrid styles of music being\ncreated by the students and faculty and to assist in their improvement.\nComing from this sensitive and delicate reciprocal relationship, I discuss\nissues of authenticity and cultural imperialism in \"world\" musics and the\ninevitability of interchange in the increasingly connected world.","author":[{"family":"Hilton","given":"C.

The male to female ratio was 0.58. The percentage of scirrhous carcinomas to all gastric carcinomas resected in the same period was three times higher in females than males. The age distribution of the patients suggested that there were two peaks in the forties and sixties in the male, and in the thirties and fifties in the female. The incidence of scirrhous carcinoma in all types of gastric carcinoma was significantly higher in the twenties, thirties and forties compared to the lowest incidence in the seventies. In the female group the primary lesion had a tendency to be adjacent to the fundic gland area and to avoid intestinal metaplasia. In the male the opposite was recognized. Cancer nests with single cells or only several cells were common in this type of carcinoma. These findings suggest that there might be two biologically different scirrhous carcinomas both in the male and the female, the appearance of single carcinoma cells might be favored by female sex hormones and young ages, and not only the original gastric mucosa but also mucosa with intestinal metaplasia could be precursors of single carcinoma cells.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Hirose","given":"Shoichiro"},{"family":"Honjou","given":"Hideo"},{"family":"Nakagawa","given":"Hikohito"},{"family":"Nishimura","given":"Keigo"},{"family":"Kuroda","given":"Yoshitaka"},{"family":"Tsuji","given":"Masahiko"},{"family":"Miwa","given":"Atsuo"},{"family":"Kitagawa","given":"Masanobu"}],"citation-key":"hiroseScirrhousCarcinomaStomach1989","container-title":"Gastroenterologia Japonica","container-title-short":"Gastroenterol Jpn","DOI":"10.1007/BF02773873","ISSN":"1435-5922","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1989",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"481-487","source":"Springer Link","title":"Scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach: A clinical and pathological study of 106 surgical cases","title-short":"Scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02773873","volume":"24"},

With the potential benefit of combining PD-1 blockade to CRT, we conducted a phase II trial which assessed the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of the combination of preoperative CRT and pembrolizumab (PEM) in ESCC. Methods: Patients (pts) with histologically confirmed ESCC (clinical stage Ib to III according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th staging system) were enrolled. Pts received concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin), radiotherapy (44.1 Gy in 21 fractions), and PEM (every 3 week, 200 mg) during 5 weeks followed by surgery. After surgery, pts were treated with PEM during 2 years or until progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or pts’ refusal, which came first. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the primary tumor and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), the incidence of adverse events, and etc. Results: In a total of 28 enrolled pts (median age 60), 26 pts received esophagectomy. Two pts did not undergo surgery due to death (hematemesis) and consent withdrawal. There were two in-hospital mortality cases after surgery, which were resulted from acute lung injury. The pCR in primary tumor was achieved in 46.1% of pts who underwent resection (95% CI: 28.8 – 64.6). With a median follow-up of 11.7 months, median OS was not reached. Six-month and 12-month OS rates were 89.3% and 82.1%, respectively. There was a trend toward better DFS in the pCR group (n = 12) compared with the non-pCR group (n = 14) (HR = 0.33, p = 0.1). Most common treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (50.0%) and liver enzyme elevation (30.8%) in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant period, respectively. Conclusions: The addition of PEM to preoperative CRT in ESCC demonstrated promising efficacy with acceptable toxicity. Based on the results, further investigation is warranted in a phase III clinical trial. The exploratory endpoints including biomarkers analyses are ongoing.

Data were collected regarding demographics, histology, staging, treatment and outcomes.\nRESULTS: Seven patients (4 female) were identified. Median age was 58 years (range 52-83 years). All patients received EBRT with concurrent doxorubicin. Six patients received surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT), and one underwent neoadjuvant CRT followed by surgery. Median radiological tumour size was 50mm (range 40-90 mm). Six patients had gross extrathyroidal extension and three had N1b disease. Prescribed radiotherapy schedules were 46.4 Gy in 29 bidaily fractions (n = 2, treated 2010), 60 Gy in 30 daily fractions (n = 2), 66 Gy in 30 fractions (n = 2) and 70 Gy in 35 fractions (n = 1; patient received neoadjuvant CRT).

  {"id":"huangContemporaryOpportunitiesNonsurgical2021","abstract":"The majority of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is now classified into two major types: HPV-mediated [HPV(+)] and HPV-negative [HPV(−)]. Within this paradigm, the 8th edition TNM staging system effected modification about what is considered “locally-advanced” HNSCC. Two phase-III trials (RTOG 1016 and De-ESCALATE HPV) disappointingly showed that cetuximab is not as effective in HPV(+) oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) compared to cisplatin with radiotherapy. The recent NRG HN002 de-escalation trial demonstrated the presence of outcome heterogeneity within “low-risk” HPV(+) OPC, some of which continue to benefit from cisplatin combined with reduced-dose radiotherapy. Moreover, distant metastasis (DM) has consolidated its position as the leading cause of death in HPV(+) OPC and strategies to mitigate it are necessary. Unanswered questions and ongoing-emerging concepts exist in both HPV(+) and HPV– diseases. These include understanding the importance of risk under the rubric of extranodal extension (ENE), including degrees of pathological ENE (pENE), and emerging knowledge about radiologic ENE (rENE). Strategies addressing modification of biological phenomena have become paramount and includes hypoxia modification (such as smoking cessation). In addition, contemporary evidence suggests that immunotherapy improves survival in recurrent/metastatic settings, and it is now also being explored in primary disease presentations in combination with (chemo-)radiotherapy. Induction chemotherapy achieves DM reduction in nasopharyngeal cancer but has only been explored minimally in HPV(+) OPC. Evidence that loco-regional management can be de-intensified following a favorable response to induction treatment would provide an attractive option for HPV(+) OPSCC patients while also addressing risk of developing distant disease.","author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Shao Hui"},{"family":"Pilar","given":"Avinash"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jishi"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Zhiyuan"},{"family":"O’Sullivan","given":"Brian"}],"citation-key":"huangContemporaryOpportunitiesNonsurgical2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_9","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

They were further randomly divided into the training and validating cohorts. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were conducted to determine significant variables for construction of nomogram. The predictive power of the model was then assessed by Harrell concordance index (C-index) and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.\nRESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that age, marital status, insurance, tumor grade, TNM stage, surgery, and chemotherapy all showed a significant association with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). These characteristics were employed to build a nomogram. Particularly, the discrimination of nomogram for OS and CSS prediction in the training set were excellent (C-index = 0.762, 95% CI: 0.754-0.770 and C-index = 0.774, 95% CI: 0.766-0.782).

By directly comparing eight treatment modalities, we found that surgery + radiotherapy (RT) ± chemotherapy was the most effective treatment strategy. surgery + chemotherapy and RT + chemotherapy had comparable results (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.461, 95% confidential interval (CI): 0.843-2.531, P = 0.177). Multivariate Cox regression analysis also showed increased mortality risk in patients with increased age (HR = 1.022, P < 0.001), tumor extension to adjacent structures (HR = 1.649, P = 0.013), and distant metastasis (HR = 2.041, P < 0.001), while surgery + RT (HR = 0.600, P = 0.004) and chemotherapy (HR = 0.692, P = 0.010) were independently associated with improved OS. Further analysis revealed that patients undergoing total/near-total thyroidectomy (TT) had superior OS to those receiving less than TT (P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the benefit of TT remained significant in patients with tumors larger than 4.0 cm (HR = 0.776, 95% CI: 0.469-0.887, P = 0.007), with adjacent structure extension (HR = 0.642, 95% CI: 0.472-0.877, P = 0.005), including trachea and major vessels, but not in patients with early phase local disease such as tumor ≤ 4.0 cm or tumor within the thyroid or with minimal extrathyroidal extension. Patients with very locally advanced disease or distant metastasis could not benefit from TT as well.\nCONCLUSIONS: In operable cases, surgery + RT ± chemotherapy was the optimal treatment modality. Otherwise, RT + chemotherapy was the appropriate strategy. However, TT was not beneficial for very early stage or metastatic ATC.","author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Nai-Si"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Xiao"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Bo-Wen"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Wen-Jun"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhong-Wu"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Peng-Cheng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Ji","given":"Qing-Hai"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yu-Long"}],"citation-key":"huangUpdateAppropriateTreatment2019","container-title":"International Journal of Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Int J Endocrinol","DOI":"10.1155/2019/8428547","ISSN":"1687-8337","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","page":"8428547","PMCID":"PMC6399533","PMID":"30915116","source":"PubMed","title":"An Update of the Appropriate Treatment Strategies in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer: A Population-Based Study of 735 Patients","title-short":"An Update of the Appropriate Treatment Strategies in Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"2019"},

We have developed a new method of endoscopic esophageal mucosal resection using a transparent tube (EMRT).

After an experimental study, EMRT was performed in 11 patients and there were no major complications. Near-total circumferential resection of the mucosa was possible, and the surface of the esophageal muscle layer (non-bleeding resection layer) was left intact. We performed this technique on a patient with a mucosal cancer of the esophagus, and succeeded in resecting the lesion during a short course of treatment.

Previously, photodynamic therapy was used to treat superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma judged to be difficult to undergo endoscopic resection. Recently, photodynamic therapy has mainly been performed for local failure after chemoradiotherapy. Although surgery is the most promising treatment for local failure after chemoradiotherapy, its morbidity and mortality rates are high. Endoscopic resection is feasible for local failure after chemoradiotherapy but requires advanced skills, and its indication is limited to within the submucosal layer by depth. Photodynamic therapy is less invasive than surgery and has a wider indication than endoscopic resection. Porfimer sodium (a first-generation photosensitizer) causes a high frequency of side effects related to photosensitivity and requires the long-term sunshade period. Talaporfin (a second-generation photosensitizer) requires a much shorter sun-shade period than porfimer sodium.

Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) constitutes over 90% of all OC cases in Golestan. In retrospective studies, cigarettes and hookah smoking, nass use (a chewing tobacco product), opium consumption, hot tea drinking, poor oral health, low intake of fresh fruit and vegetables, and low socioeconomic status have been associated with higher risk of OSCC in Golestan. However, the association of tobacco with OSCC in this area is not as strong as that seen in Western countries. Alcohol is consumed by a very small percentage of the population and is not a risk factor for OSCC in this area. Other factors, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, N-nitroso compounds, drinking water contaminants, infections, food contamination with mycotoxins, and genetic factors merit further investigation as risk factors for OSCC in Golestan.

  {"id":"itoCostEffectivenessSutimlimabStandardofCare2023","abstract":"Introduction:Primary cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is an autoimmune hemolytic anemia characterized by the presence of cold-reactive antibodies that lead to red blood cell destruction at low temperatures. Patients with CAD who are transfusion-dependent experience the burden of increased health resource utilization and reduced quality-of-life. The standard-of-care (SOC) in patients with primary CAD has included chemoimmunotherapy, transfusion support, and cold avoidance. Sutimlimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits C1-mediated hemolysis. It is the only FDA-approved therapeutic for patients with cold agglutinin disease regardless of history of transfusion, with approval based on two phase 3 clinical studies. The cost-effectiveness of this expensive therapeutic in the care of patients with either transfusion-independent or transfusion-dependent primary CAD is not known. We sought to fill this gap by determining the cost-effectiveness of sutimlimab versus standard-of-care for the transfusion-dependent patient population with primary CAD.Methods:For this independent analysis free of industry influence, we built a Markov state transition model of adult patients with transfusion-dependent primary CAD to determine the cost-effectiveness of sutimlimab versus SOC, over a lifetime time-horizon and across accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). For transition probabilities, we employed phase 3 study data (NCT03347396) with descriptive statistics informing the documented pre- versus on-sutimlimab clinical benefit, including the decrement in hemolytic anemia severity and transfusion burden. For SOC, we assumed that all patients undergo the costs and risks of chemoimmunotherapy with bendamustine-rituximab, followed by rituximab monotherapy and subsequent treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, with all patients remaining dependent on transfusion care. Health resource utilization costs for SOC were further supplemented with country- and disease-specific real-world costs over a median of 42.8 and 33.0 months of follow-up after incident primary CAD diagnosis across two claims databases. These costs were assessed from the highest of 1) annualized cost quartile and 2) the worst ordinal category of hemolytic anemia severity (defined as hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL) across all of 1) hospitalizations, 2) emergency visits, 3) outpatient services, and 4) blood transfusions. We assumed no loss of sutimlimab efficacy and no discontinuation off sutimlimab due to adverse events. Age- and sex-adjusted, disease-specific mortality was employed. Effectiveness was calculated in QALYs and was informed directly from trial-specific utilities. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) or the incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB), if the intervention was found to be cost-saving. The secondary outcome was a scenario analysis for patients with a body weight of &lt;75 kilograms that mandate lower dosing per-kilogram sutimlimab dosing, as per the FDA package insert. We concluded by conducting deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, capturing uncertainty in all parameters simultaneously over 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.Results:In the base-case analysis, treatment with sutimlimab versus SOC accrued 5.60 and 4.79 QALYs at costs of $9.52 and $7.67 million, respectively, with the ICER for sutimlimab treatment being $2,280,000/QALY [95% credible interval 960,000-13,900,000]. In the scenario analysis for patients with lower body weight (i.e., lower sutimlimab dosing), the ICER was $1,910,000/QALY. Model results were sensitive to sutimlimab cost. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, SOC was favored over sutimlimab in 100% of 10,000 iterations. An exploratory threshold analysis showed that the mortality hazard with sutimlimab would need to decrease by 201% for sutimlimab to become cost-effective.Conclusion:Sutimlimab is conventionally cost-ineffective compared to SOC in transfusion-dependent patients with CAD. Distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA) to potentially justify sutimlimab as an equitable therapeutic option despite cost-ineffectiveness in the United States context is needed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ito","given":"Satoko"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Purcell","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Chetlapalli","given":"Karthik"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Alfred I"},{"family":"Cuker","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Goshua","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"itoCostEffectivenessSutimlimabStandardofCare2023","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2023-187270","ISSN":"0006-4971","issue":"Supplement 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,28]]},"page":"2316","source":"Silverchair","title":"Cost-Effectiveness of Sutimlimab Versus Standard-of-Care in Transfusion Dependent Patients with Primary Cold Agglutinin Disease in the United States","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2023-187270","volume":"142"},

Sutimlimab rapidly abrogated extravascular hemolysis, normalizing bilirubin levels within 24 hours in most patients and normalizing haptoglobin levels in 4 patients within 1 week. Hemolytic anemia recurred when drug levels were cleared from the circulation 3 to 4 weeks after the last dose of sutimlimab. Reexposure to sutimlimab in a named patient program recapitulated the control of hemolytic anemia. All 6 previously transfused patients became transfusion-free during treatment. Sutimlimab was safe, well tolerated, and rapidly stopped C1s complement-mediated hemolysis in patients with cold agglutinin disease, significantly increasing hemoglobin levels and precluding the need for transfusions. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02502903.","author":[{"family":"Jäger","given":"Ulrich"},{"family":"D'Sa","given":"Shirley"},{"family":"Schörgenhofer","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Bartko","given":"Johann"},{"family":"Derhaschnig","given":"Ulla"},{"family":"Sillaber","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Jilma-Stohlawetz","given":"Petra"},{"family":"Fillitz","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Schenk","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Patou","given":"Gary"},{"family":"Panicker","given":"Sandip"},{"family":"Parry","given":"Graham C."},{"family":"Gilbert","given":"James C."},{"family":"Jilma","given":"Bernd"}],"citation-key":"jagerInhibitionComplementC1s2019","container-title":"Blood","container-title-short":"Blood","DOI":"10.1182/blood-2018-06-856930","ISSN":"1528-0020","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",2,28]]},"language":"eng","page":"893-901","PMCID":"PMC6396179","PMID":"30559259","source":"PubMed","title":"Inhibition of complement C1s improves severe hemolytic anemia in cold agglutinin disease: a first-in-human trial","title-short":"Inhibition of complement C1s improves severe hemolytic anemia in cold agglutinin disease","type":"article-journal","volume":"133"},
  {"id":"jainSeekYouShall2013","abstract":"Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) during cardiac surgery can involve deliberate hypothermia of the systemic (22-36 °C) and coronary circulations (as low as 8-12 °C). Adverse sequelae of cold-active antibodies have been feared and reported under such conditions, and some centers thus elect to screen for cold agglutinins before CPB. We reviewed the literature on cold agglutinins in cardiac surgery and described the yields and effects of cold agglutinin screening (CAS) in 14,900 cardiac surgery patients undergoing CPB over 8 years at a single institution. Cold agglutinin screening was positive in 47 cases (0.3%), at an annual testing cost of $17,000 CAD. The response of the surgical team to the preoperative discovery of a cold agglutinin was variable, with CPB modified to avoid hypothermia in approximately one-third of cases. In patients discovered to have a positive CAS, postoperative intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were marginally increased (54.6 vs. 42.8 hours, P = .02; 7 [6-14] vs. 7 [5-9] days, P = .04). However, the composite of mortality or severe morbidity (stroke, myocardial infarction, dialysis, low output syndrome, sepsis, and deep vein thrombosis) was not significantly different (14.9% vs. 9.2%, P = .2). Antibody verification found that only 43% of positive CAS patients had true cold agglutinins (20 patients). Furthermore, the rate of adverse events was low in both CAS-positive and true-positive cold agglutinin patients undergoing CPB and cardiac surgery. Finally, modification of CPB to attenuate hypothermia did not decrease adverse events. Based upon historical and local data, preclinical CAS is cost-substantial and nonspecific. Cold agglutinin screening does not promote an algorithm of care that meaningfully improves patient CPB outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Jain","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Cabrerizo-Sanchez","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Karkouti","given":"Keyvan"},{"family":"Yau","given":"Terrence"},{"family":"Pendergrast","given":"Jacob M."},{"family":"Cserti-Gazdewich","given":"Christine M."}],"citation-key":"jainSeekYouShall2013","container-title":"Transfusion Medicine Reviews","container-title-short":"Transfus Med Rev","DOI":"10.1016/j.tmrv.2012.12.001","ISSN":"1532-9496","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"65-73","PMID":"23375735","source":"PubMed","title":"Seek and you shall find--but then what do you do?

Its prognosis is poor: the median overall survival (OS) of patients varies from 4 to 10 months after diagnosis. However, a doubling of the OS time may be possible owing to a more systematic use of molecular tests for targeted therapies and integration of fast-track dedicated care pathways for these patients in tertiary centers. The diagnostic confirmation, if needed, requires an urgent biopsy reread by an expert pathologist with additional immunohistochemical and molecular analyses. Therapeutic management, defined in multidisciplinary meetings, respecting the patient's choice, must start within days following diagnosis. For localized disease diagnosed after primary surgical treatment, adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy is recommended. In the event of locally advanced or metastatic disease, the prognosis is very poor. Treatment should then involve chemotherapy or targeted therapy and decompressive cervical radiotherapy.

  {"id":"jiangDefiningCisplatinEligibility2021","abstract":"The current treatment paradigm for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) consists of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by local definitive therapy, or local definitive therapy alone for cisplatin-ineligible patients. Given that MIBC has a high propensity for distant relapse and is a chemotherapy-sensitive disease, under-utilization of chemotherapy is associated with suboptimal cure rates. Cisplatin eligibility criteria are defined for patients with metastatic bladder cancer by the Galsky criteria, which include creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min. However, consensus is still lacking regarding cisplatin eligibility criteria in the neoadjuvant, curative MIBC setting, which continues to represent a substantial barrier to the standardization of patient care and clinical trial design. Jiang and colleagues accordingly suggest an algorithm for assessing cisplatin eligibility in patients with MIBC. Instead of relying on an absolute renal function threshold, their algorithm emphasizes a multidisciplinary and patient-centred approach. They also propose mitigation strategies to minimize the risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in selected patients with impaired renal function. This new framework is aimed at reducing the inappropriate exclusion of some patients from cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (which leads to under-treatment) and harmonizing clinical trial design, which could lead to improved overall outcomes in patients with MIBC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Jiang","given":"Di Maria"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Shilpa"},{"family":"Kitchlu","given":"Abhijat"},{"family":"Meraz-Munoz","given":"Alejandro"},{"family":"North","given":"Scott A."},{"family":"Alimohamed","given":"Nimira S."},{"family":"Blais","given":"Normand"},{"family":"Sridhar","given":"Srikala S."}],"citation-key":"jiangDefiningCisplatinEligibility2021","container-title":"Nature Reviews Urology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Urol","DOI":"10.1038/s41585-020-00404-6","ISSN":"1759-4820","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"language":"en","license":"2021 Springer Nature Limited","number":"2","page":"104-114","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Defining cisplatin eligibility in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41585-020-00404-6","volume":"18"},

The objective of this study was to determine the differences in characteristics between ATC and PSCCTh and establish prognostic models.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: All variables of patients with ATC and PSCCTh, diagnosed from 2004-2015, were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database. Percentage differences for categorical data were compared using the Chi-square test. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox-regression for survival analysis, and C-index value was used to evaluate the performance of the prognostic models.\nRESULTS: After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1164 ATC and 124 PSCCTh patients, diagnosed from 2004 to 2015, were included in the study. There were no differences in sex, ethnicity, age, marital status, or percentage of proximal metastases between the two cancers; however, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, incidence of surgical treatment, and presence of multiple primary tumors were higher in patients with ATC than those with PSCCTh. Further cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with PSCCTh was better than that of patients with ATC. Prognostic factors were not identical for the two cancers. Multivariate Cox model analysis indicated that age, sex, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, multiple primary tumors, marital status, and distant metastasis status are independent prognostic factors for CSS in patients with ATC, while for patients with PSCCTh, the corresponding factors are age, radiotherapy, multiple primary tumors, and surgery. The C-index values of the two models were both > 0.8, indicating that the models exhibited good discriminative ability.\nCONCLUSION: Prognostic factors influencing CSS were not identical in patients with ATC and PSCCTh. These findings indicate that different clinical treatment and management plans are required for patients with these two types of thyroid cancer.","author":[{"family":"Jin","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Xiangmei"},{"family":"Peng","given":"Dandan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Dahuan"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Yuan-Nong"}],"citation-key":"jinDifferencesCancerSpecificSurvival2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2022.830760","ISSN":"1664-2392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"830760","PMCID":"PMC8960140","PMID":"35360080","source":"PubMed","title":"Differences Between Cancer-Specific Survival of Patients With Anaplastic and Primary Squamous Cell Thyroid Carcinoma and Factors Influencing Prognosis: A SEER Database Analysis","title-short":"Differences Between Cancer-Specific Survival of Patients With Anaplastic and Primary Squamous Cell Thyroid Carcinoma and Factors Influencing Prognosis","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Response to available therapies is still disappointing. Aim of the present review is to illustrate the diverse new strategies under investigation, to improve the poor outcome of these patients.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Applying molecular analysis in ATC is unravelling potentially actionable targets of therapy. If a mutation of BRAF V600E is found, a combination of Dabrafenib and Trametinib is the recommended treatment. In the presence of another druggable mutation, a specific targeted therapy may be proposed. In the absence of druggable mutations, immunotherapy is an alternative approach, especially in case of significant PD-L1 expression.\nSUMMARY: The molecular profiling of tumour samples is elucidating the genetic alterations involved in ATC development, and new preclinical models are under study to define innovative approaches for individualized treatment of such patients.

  {"id":"kakejiMultimodalityApproachesControl2021","abstract":"Esophageal cancer has a poor prognosis despite the fact that surgical techniques have been advanced and optimized, and systemic multimodality approaches have progressed recently. Adding chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy to the basic surgical approach have been shown to have therapeutic benefit for esophageal cancer. This review describes the latest development of chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, which have contributed to the reduction in esophageal cancer growth and improved the survival of patients. Chemoradiation is a treatment option for resectable esophageal cancer to preserve the esophagus for patients who cannot tolerate surgery. Moreover, a combination of chemoradiotherapy and salvage surgery could extend the survival of patients. The effects of a triplet chemotherapy regimen are currently being verified in some Phase III studies for unresectable advanced/recurrent esophageal cancer. In addition, with the great promise of immune checkpoint inhibitors, strategies that incorporate the use of immunotherapy may shift from the metastatic setting to the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting as a result of clinical trials. More precise comprehension of the molecular biology of esophageal cancer is expected to further control disease progression using multimodality treatments in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kakeji","given":"Yoshihiro"},{"family":"Oshikiri","given":"Taro"},{"family":"Takiguchi","given":"Gosuke"},{"family":"Kanaji","given":"Shingo"},{"family":"Matsuda","given":"Takeru"},{"family":"Nakamura","given":"Tetsu"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Satoshi"}],"citation-key":"kakejiMultimodalityApproachesControl2021","container-title":"Esophagus","container-title-short":"Esophagus","DOI":"10.1007/s10388-020-00782-1","ISSN":"1612-9067","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"25-32","source":"Springer Link","title":"Multimodality approaches to control esophageal cancer: development of chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy","title-short":"Multimodality approaches to control esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10388-020-00782-1","volume":"18"},

  {"id":"kamperschroerColdAgglutininDisease2023","abstract":"Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) is a condition involving anemia and its related symptoms; it is caused by autoantibodies that bind and agglutinate red blood cells in areas susceptible to hypothermia, such as extremities exposed to cold temperatures. CAD is rare, with 5 to 20 human cases per million individuals. In this report, we describe a case of CAD in a previously healthy and experimentally naïve adult Indian rhesus macaque that was housed indoors and presented with blood in the urine. After our observations of hemoglobinuria and anemia led us to suspect CAD, we demonstrated that the macaque's blood agglutinated at reduced temperatures. We also noticed that the provision of cold foraging treats triggered episodes of hemoglobinuria. Further investigation revealed that serum from the macaque agglutinated RBCs in vitro with high thermal amplitude (at or below 30 °C) and had an antibody titer of 8 to 32. The serum contained autoantibodies of the immunoglobulin M (IgM) isotype; agglutinins of the IgG isotype were not detected. The cold-dependent IgM autoantibodies in the serum from the affected macaque reacted against a common RBC antigen because RBCs collected from other macaques were bound and agglutinated by the affected animal's IgM under cold conditions. This in vitro binding activity was reversible when the test temperature was returned to normal body temperature (37 °C). These findings demonstrated cold-dependent RBC-specific IgM agglutinins and led us to a diagnosis of CAD. This is the first documented case of spontaneous CAD in a rhesus macaque.","author":[{"family":"Kamperschroer","given":"Cris"},{"family":"Tartaro","given":"Karrie"},{"family":"Goodchild","given":"Laurie"},{"family":"Menke","given":"Chelsea"},{"family":"Artrip","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Pisharath","given":"Harshan"}],"citation-key":"kamperschroerColdAgglutininDisease2023","container-title":"Comparative Medicine","container-title-short":"Comp Med","DOI":"10.30802/AALAS-CM-23-000025","ISSN":"2769-819X","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,29]]},"language":"eng","page":"398-406","PMCID":"PMC10702163","PMID":"38087406","source":"PubMed","title":"Cold Agglutinin Disease in a Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta)","type":"article-journal","volume":"73"},

  {"id":"kantetiAnaplasticCancerOur2022","abstract":"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare thyroid malignancy with a dire prognosis, nearly 100% disease specific mortality and a median overall survival less than 6 months. In view of the limited data from India on anaplastic thyroid cancer, we conducted this audit to analyze the treatment pattern, outcomes and factors influencing it. This is a retrospective analysis of outcomes of patients treated in a single institution between January 2008 and December 2020. Baseline characteristics, treatment received, and outcomes among adult patients with ATC were collected. Progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. SPSS version 20 and RStudio version 3.1.1 were used for analysis. In this cohort of 134 patients, the median age at diagnosis was 59 years, with 63.4% of them being females. At presentation, 70.9% of them had good performance status (PS 0-1). Only 38.8% received treatment with curative intent (either surgery fb adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy fb surgery and adjuvant or definitive chemoradiotherapy) while 61.2% patients received palliative treatment (either palliation alone or palliative chemotherapy or palliative surgery or palliative RT). Predominant pattern of progression was local progression (79.8%). Median PFS and OS of the overall cohort were 58 days and 80 days respectively. PFS and OS were significantly better in patients treated with curative intent vs palliative intent (116 and 134 days vs 45 and 50 days; p = 0.00 and 0.00 respectively). Among patients treated with curative intent, OS was significantly better in patients undergoing surgery vs CTRT (155 vs 76 days; p = 0.03). Among patients treated with upfront surgery, both PFS and OS were better with the addition of adjuvant CTRT/RT vs no adjuvant (332 and 540 days vs 55 and 91 days; p = 0.00 and 0.003 respectively). ATC is a rare cancer with dismal prognosis. Local therapy with surgery followed adjuvant seems to be associated with the better outcomes. Systemic therapy seems to be a better option for palliation. Our data reflects the real world data of this rare cancer.","author":[{"family":"Kanteti","given":"Aditya Pavan Kumar"},{"family":"Ghose","given":"Joy"},{"family":"Patil","given":"Vijay Maruti"},{"family":"Tamhankar","given":"Anup Sunil"},{"family":"Abraham","given":"George"},{"family":"Noronha","given":"Vanita"},{"family":"Laskar","given":"Sarbani Ghosh"},{"family":"Menon","given":"Nandini Sharrel"},{"family":"Pai","given":"Prathamesh S."},{"family":"Prabhash","given":"Kumar"}],"citation-key":"kantetiAnaplasticCancerOur2022","container-title":"Indian Journal of Surgical Oncology","container-title-short":"Indian J Surg Oncol","DOI":"10.1007/s13193-022-01576-w","ISSN":"0975-7651","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"789-796","PMCID":"PMC9845457","PMID":"36687234","source":"PubMed","title":"Anaplastic Cancer: Our Experience","title-short":"Anaplastic Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"karamanouHallmarksHistoryEsophageal2017","abstract":"Esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers due to its aggressive behavior and poor survival. It was mentioned in the works of ancient Chinese and Arabo-islamic physicians, centuries before the recognition of high incidence in the Asian esophageal cancer belt. Till the 19th century the disease was considered incurable and the main goal of the proposed treatments was to alleviate dysphagia and pain. The introduction of esophagoscope in 1868 by Adolf Kussmaul (1822-1902) contributed to the observation of the living esophagus and to the diagnosis of esophageal pathologies, paving the way for new therapeutic approaches. In 1877, Vincenz Czerny (1842-1916) performed the first successful resection of the cervical esophagus for carcinoma, followed by Franz Torek (1861-1938) who carried out in 1913 the first successful subtotal thoracic esophagectomy and Tohru Ohsawa (1882-1984) who performed the world's first esophagectomy with an intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis. Nowadays, despite the advent of biomedical technology and the development of operation techniques, the surgical treatment of esophagus still remains a challenge.","author":[{"family":"Karamanou","given":"Marianna"},{"family":"Markatos","given":"Kostas"},{"family":"Papaioannou","given":"Theodoros G."},{"family":"Zografos","given":"George"},{"family":"Androutsos","given":"George"}],"citation-key":"karamanouHallmarksHistoryEsophageal2017","container-title":"Journal of B.U.ON.: official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology","container-title-short":"J BUON","ISSN":"1107-0625","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1088-1091","PMID":"28952239","source":"PubMed","title":"Hallmarks in history of esophageal carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},

The search encompassed articles published up to 5/2023. Additionally, manual searches of reference lists of selected articles and pertinent review papers were conducted to ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant studies. Studies were included if they provided insights into clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of CPIs in treating advanced gastroesophageal cancers. Relevant case reviews and trials exploring combination therapies involving CPIs were also considered. Articles discussed in the utilization of predictive biomarkers were included to assess their impact on treatment outcomes. Data from selected studies were extracted to inform the narrative review. Key findings were summarized, including clinical trial designs, patient populations, treatment regimens, response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events. The role of predictive biomarkers, particularly PD-L1 expression and MSI status, in identifying patients likely to benefit from CPIs was critically evaluated based on study results. Ongoing clinical trials investigating novel combination strategies and exploring the broader scope of CPIs in gastroesophageal cancers were also highlighted. The collected data were synthesized to provide a comprehensive overview of the crucial clinical trials that have contributed to the approval of CPIs for advanced gastroesophageal cancers. The role of CPIs in different lines of therapy, including first-line regimens, was discussed. Furthermore, the evolving landscape of predictive biomarkers was examined, emphasizing their potential significance in optimizing patient selection for CPI therapy. Ongoing clinical trials were reviewed to underscore the continuous efforts in expanding treatment options and improving patient outcomes in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Karim","given":"Frederic"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Adina"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Vishnuvardhan","given":"Nivetha"},{"family":"Amin","given":"Saif"},{"family":"Shabbir","given":"Raffey"},{"family":"Swed","given":"Brandon"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Uqba"}],"citation-key":"karimRoleCheckpointInhibitors2023","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15164099","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,14]]},"language":"en","page":"4099","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Role of Checkpoint Inhibitors in the Management of Gastroesophageal Cancers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/15/16/4099","volume":"15"},

Adults with resected (R0) stage II or III esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and had residual pathological disease were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, followed by nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks) or matching placebo. The maximum duration of the trial intervention period was 1 year. The primary end point was disease-free survival.\nRESULTS: The median follow-up was 24.4 months. Among the 532 patients who received nivolumab, the median disease-free survival was 22.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.6 to 34.0), as compared with 11.0 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 14.3) among the 262 patients who received placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence or death, 0.69; 96.4% CI, 0.56 to 0.86; P<0.001). Disease-free survival favored nivolumab across multiple prespecified subgroups. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to the active drug or placebo occurred in 71 of 532 patients (13%) in the nivolumab group and 15 of 260 patients (6%) in the placebo group. The trial regimen was discontinued because of adverse events related to the active drug or placebo in 9% of the patients in the nivolumab group and 3% of those in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients with resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, disease-free survival was significantly longer among those who received nivolumab adjuvant therapy than among those who received placebo.

  {"id":"kellyImmunotherapyEsophagealGastric2017","abstract":"PD-L1 upregulation occurs in approximately 40% of gastroesophageal cancers. However, unlike other solid tumors, there is minimal PD-L1 expressed on the cancer cells; rather, expression occurs predominantly on infiltrating myeloid cells. Preliminary clinical data involving single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in metastatic gastroesophageal cancer have reported response rates of 22%–27% for patients with PD-L1+ tumors and 10%–17% for unselected patients. The phase III ONO-4538-12 (ATTRACTION 2) trial has demonstrated an improved overall survival for nivolumab compared with placebo for patients with heavily pretreated gastric cancer. In the future, we will need better biomarkers to select those most likely to respond and/or identify patients who may need combination immunotherapeutics or alternate strategies. A number of subsets of gastric cancer with different immune signatures, most notably tumors positive for Epstein-Barr virus and microsatellite instability, have been identified, with approximately 50% and 94% PD-L1+ staining seen on tumor cells and immune cells in the EBV subtype and approximately 33% and 45% PD-L1+ staining seen on tumor cells and immune cells in MSI high tumors. Both subtypes demonstrate PD-L1+ immune cells with tumor-infiltrating patterns, unlike the more commonly seen PD-L1+ immune cells at the invasive margin. PD-L2 expression has been reported in 52% of esophageal adenocarcinomas but little is known about the expression of other immune checkpoints. Additional factors that suggest gastroesophageal cancers may respond to checkpoint inhibition include the high somatic mutation burden and the link with chronic inflammation. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the checkpoint inhibitor data published to date in advanced esophagogastric cancers and rationalize how the immune microenvironment in these diverse tumors can explain response or resistance to immunotherapeutics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Kelly","given":"Ronan J."}],"citation-key":"kellyImmunotherapyEsophagealGastric2017","container-title":"American Society of Clinical Oncology Educational Book","DOI":"10.1200/EDBK_175231","ISSN":"1548-8748","issue":"37","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",5]]},"page":"292-300","publisher":"Wolters Kluwer","source":"ascopubs.org (Atypon)","title":"Immunotherapy for Esophageal and Gastric Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/EDBK_175231"},

After a median possible study time of 55.4 months, there were no significant differences between the two groups in median survival: 14.9 months for the patients who received preoperative chemotherapy and 16.1 months for those who underwent immediate surgery (P=0.53). At one year, the survival rate was 59 percent for those who received chemotherapy and 60 percent for those who had surgery alone; at two years, survival was 35 percent and 37 percent, respectively. The toxic effects of chemotherapy were tolerable, and the addition of chemotherapy did not appear to increase the morbidity or mortality associated with surgery. There were no differences in survival between patients with squamous-cell carcinoma and those with adenocarcinoma. Weight loss was a significant predictor of poor outcome (P=0.03).

  {"id":"kelsenLongtermResultsRTOG2007","abstract":"PURPOSE: We update Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 8911 (USA Intergroup 113), a comparison of chemotherapy plus surgery versus surgery alone for patients with localized esophageal cancer. The relationship between resection type and between tumor response and outcome were also analyzed.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The chemotherapy group received preoperative cisplatin plus fluorouracil. Outcome based on the type of resection (R0, R1, R2, or no resection) was evaluated. The main end point was overall survival. Disease-free survival, relapse pattern, the influence of postoperative treatment, and the relationship between response to preoperative chemotherapy and outcome were also evaluated.\nRESULTS: Two hundred sixteen patients received preoperative chemotherapy, 227 underwent immediate surgery. Fifty-nine percent of surgery only and 63% of chemotherapy plus surgery patients underwent R0 resections (P = .5137). Patients undergoing less than an R0 resection had an ominous prognosis; 32% of patients with R0 resections were alive and free of disease at 5 years, only 5% of patients undergoing an R1 resection survived for longer than 5 years. The median survival rates for patients with R1, R2, or no resections were not significantly different. While, as initially reported, there was no difference in overall survival for patients receiving perioperative chemotherapy compared with the surgery only group, patients with objective tumor regression after preoperative chemotherapy had improved survival.\nCONCLUSION: For patients with localized esophageal cancer, whether or not preoperative chemotherapy is administered, only an R0 resection results in substantial long-term survival. Even microscopically positive margins are an ominous prognostic factor. After a R1 resection, postoperative chemoradiotherapy therapy offers the possibility of long-term disease-free survival to a small percentage of patients.","author":[{"family":"Kelsen","given":"David P."},{"family":"Winter","given":"Katryn A."},{"family":"Gunderson","given":"Leonard L."},{"family":"Mortimer","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Estes","given":"Norman C."},{"family":"Haller","given":"Daniel G."},{"family":"Ajani","given":"Jaffer A."},{"family":"Kocha","given":"Walter"},{"family":"Minsky","given":"Bruce D."},{"family":"Roth","given":"Jack A."},{"family":"Willett","given":"Christopher G."},{"literal":"Radiation Therapy Oncology Group"},{"literal":"USA Intergroup"}],"citation-key":"kelsenLongtermResultsRTOG2007","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2006.10.4760","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",8,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"3719-3725","PMID":"17704421","source":"PubMed","title":"Long-term results of RTOG trial 8911 (USA Intergroup 113): a random assignment trial comparison of chemotherapy followed by surgery compared with surgery alone for esophageal cancer","title-short":"Long-term results of RTOG trial 8911 (USA Intergroup 113)","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},

PPGLs are associated with a high mortality rate and several complications. To date, no epidemiological studies have been conducted on PPGLs in Asia. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and prognosis of PPGLs in Korea using nationwide data.\nMETHODS: Using the National Health Insurance Service Database, subjects with a principal diagnosis of PPGLs on two or more occasions between 2003 and 2014 who satisfied the operational definition of PPGLs were included. Incidence, prevalence, complications, metastasis, and mortality were investigated.\nRESULTS: In total, 1048 subjects with a mean age of 47.6±16.1 years were included. There was no sex preponderance. The overall prevalence of PPGLs was 2.13 per 100,000 persons, and the overall age-standardized incidence rate was 0.18 per 100,000 person-years. Malignant PPGLs accounted for 17.7% (185 of 1,048) of cases, and 94 subjects exhibited metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Among initially non-metastatic PPGLs, 9.5% (nine of 954) eventually metastasized after a mean duration of 78.1±41.4 months. The 5-year survival rates for non-metastatic and metastatic PPGLs at diagnosis were 97% and 84%, respectively.

  {"id":"kimRacialDisparitiesCancerrelated2017","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer makes up approximately 1% of all diagnosed cancers in the US. There is a persistent disparity in incidence and cancer-related mortality rates among different races for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Most previous studies investigated racial disparities between black and white patients, occasionally examining disparities for Hispanic patients. Studies including Asians/Pacific Islanders (API) as a subgroup are rare. Our objective was to determine whether there is an association between race and cancer-related survival in patients with esophageal SCC.\nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a retrospective cohort study using the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database. The SEER registry is a national database that collects information on all incident cancer cases in 13 states of the United States and covers nearly 26% of the US population Patients aged 18 and over of White, Black, or Asian/Pacific Islander (API) race with diagnosed esophageal SCC from 1973 to 2013 were included (n = 13,857). To examine overall survival, Kaplan-Meier curves were estimated for each race and the log-rank test was used to compare survival distributions. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The final adjusted model controlled for sex, marital status, age at diagnosis, decade of diagnosis, ethnicity, stage at diagnosis, and form of treatment. Additional analyses stratified by decade of diagnosis were conducted to explore possible changes in survival disparities over time. After adjustment for potential confounders, black patients had a statistically significantly higher hazard ratio compared to white patients (HR 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.13). However, API patients did not show a statistically significant difference in survival compared with white patients (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.93-1.07). Patients diagnosed between 1973 and 1979 had twice the hazard of death compared to those diagnosed between 2000 and 2013 (HR 2.05, 95% CI 1.93-2.19). Patients diagnosed in 1980-1989 and 1990-1999 had had HRs of 1.59 (95% CI 1.51-1.68) and 1.33 (95% CI 1.26-1.41), respectively. After stratification according to decade of diagnosis, the HR for black patients compared with white patients was 1.14 (95% CI 1.02-1.29) in 1973-1979 and 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.23) in 1980-1989.

Survival disparities between races appear to have decreased over time.

Therefore, these patients cannot receive an additional SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination and have a higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Primary end points were overall survival (OS) in patients with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 10, in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, and in all patients (one-sided α 0.9%, 0.8%, and 0.8%, respectively).\nRESULTS: At final analysis, conducted 16 months after the last patient was randomly assigned, OS was prolonged with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for patients with CPS ≥ 10 (median, 9.3 v 6.7 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.52 to 0.93]; P = .0074). Estimated 12-month OS rate was 43% (95% CI, 33.5% to 52.1%) with pembrolizumab versus 20% (95% CI, 13.5% to 28.3%) with chemotherapy.

  {"id":"lanCOVIDScraperOpenSourceToolset2021","abstract":"In 2019, COVID-19 quickly spread across the world, infecting billions of people and disrupting the normal lives of citizens in every country. Governments, organizations, and research institutions all over the world are dedicating vast resources to research effective strategies to fight this rapidly propagating virus. With virus testing, most countries publish the number of confirmed cases, dead cases, recovered cases, and locations routinely through various channels and forms. This important data source has enabled researchers worldwide to perform different COVID-19 scientific studies, such as modeling this virus's spreading patterns, developing prevention strategies, and studying the impact of COVID-19 on other aspects of society. However, one major challenge is that there is no standardized, updated, and high-quality data product that covers COVID-19 cases data internationally. This is because different countries may publish their data in unique channels, formats, and time intervals, which hinders researchers from fetching necessary COVID-19 datasets effectively, especially for fine-scale studies. Although existing solutions such as John's Hopkins COVID-19 Dashboard and 1point3acres COVID-19 tracker are widely used, it is difficult for users to access their original dataset and customize those data to meet specific requirements in categories, data structure, and data source selection. To address this challenge, we developed a toolset using cloud-based web scraping to extract, refine, unify, and store COVID-19 cases data at multiple scales for all available countries around the world automatically. The toolset then publishes the data for public access in an effective manner, which could offer users a real time COVID-19 dynamic dataset with a global view. Two case studies are presented about how to utilize the datasets. This toolset can also be easily extended to fulfill other purposes with its open-source nature.","author":[{"family":"Lan","given":"Hai"},{"family":"Sha","given":"Dexuan"},{"family":"Malarvizhi","given":"Anusha Srirenganathan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yun"},{"family":"Meister","given":"Nadine"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zifu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jingchao"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Chaowei Phil"}],"citation-key":"lanCOVIDScraperOpenSourceToolset2021","container-title":"IEEE access: practical innovations, open solutions","container-title-short":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3085682","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"84783-84798","PMCID":"PMC8545187","PMID":"34812396","source":"PubMed","title":"COVID-Scraper: An Open-Source Toolset for Automatically Scraping and Processing Global Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal COVID-19 Records","title-short":"COVID-Scraper","type":"article-journal","volume":"9"},

End points were cancer and therapy-related deaths.\nRESULTS: Sixty-six patients (89%) in the chemotherapy group underwent resection compared with 69 (95%) in the control group (p = not significant). Of the 60 patients who had resection after completing the chemotherapy program, 35 (58%) had a significant response, of whom four (6.7%) had a complete pathologic response. Postoperative mortality rates were 8.3% and 8.7% in the chemotherapy and control groups, respectively (p = not significant). Significant downstaging was evident with chemotherapy; curative resections were possible in 67% of these patients compared with 35% in the control group (p = 0.0003). T3 and T4 tumors were found in 67% and 91% of the chemotherapy and control groups, respectively (p = 0.0002). The respective figures for N1 disease were 70% and 88% (p = 0.009). An intent-to-treat analysis of survival showed no significant difference between the two groups. Median survivals were 16.8 and 13 months, respectively (p = 0.17). Of those who completed the chemotherapy and resection, responders fared better than control patients. Median survivals were 42.2 months and 13.8 months, respectively (p = 0.003). Median survival (8.3 months) was worse for nonresponders than for control patients (p = 0.03). The recurrence pattern suggested a significant reduction in locoregional disease with chemotherapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Preoperative chemotherapy was safe and resulted in significant downstaging and an increased likelihood of curative resection. Survival was not better than that in the surgery-alone group, but responders did fare better than nonresponders.","author":[{"family":"Law","given":"S."},{"family":"Fok","given":"M."},{"family":"Chow","given":"S."},{"family":"Chu","given":"K.

With the potential benefit of combining PD-1 blockade to CRT, we conducted a phase II trial which assessed the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of the combination of preoperative CRT and pembrolizumab (PEM) in ESCC (NCT02844075).\nMethods\nPatients (pts) with histologically confirmed ESCC (clinical stage Ib to III according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7th staging system) were enrolled. Pts received concurrent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin), radiotherapy (44.1Gy in 21 fractions), and PEM (every 3 weeks, 200mg) during 5 weeks followed by surgery. After surgery, pts were treated with PEM during 2 years or until progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or pts’ refusal, which came first. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the primary tumor and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), the incidence of adverse events, and etc.\nResults\nIn a total of 28 enrolled pts (median age 60), 26 pts received esophagectomy. Two pts did not undergo surgery due to death (hematemesis) and consent withdrawal. There were two in-hospital mortality cases after surgery due to acute lung injury and four mortality cases due to disease progression. The pCR in primary tumor was achieved in 46.1% of pts who underwent resection (95% CI: 28.8 – 64.6). With a median follow-up of 12.4 months, median OS was not reached. Six, 12, and 18-month OS rates were 89.3%, 80.8%, and 73.1% respectively. There was a trend toward better DFS in the pCR group (n=12) compared with the non-pCR group (n=14) (HR=0.33, p=0.1). Most common treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (50.0%) and liver enzyme elevation (30.8%) in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant period, respectively.\nConclusions\nThe addition of PEM to preoperative CRT in ESCC demonstrated promising efficacy with acceptable toxicity. Based on the results, further investigation is warranted in a phase III clinical trial. The exploratory endpoints including biomarkers analyses are ongoing.\nClinical trial identification\nNCT02844075.\nLegal entity responsible for the study\nThe authors.\nFunding\nMSD.\nDisclosure\nAll authors have declared no conflicts of interest.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"S."},{"family":"Ahn","given":"B.

Obtaining information to characterize ATC is difficult because ATC with distant metastasis is extremely rare. This study determined the clinical characteristics of ATC with distant metastasis. The medical records of 152 patients with ATC at Gangnam Severance Hospital were reviewed between January 2004 and March 2022. The primary endpoint was the overall survival of the total patient sample, patients with ATC and distant metastasis, and those with ATC and brain metastasis. Of the 152 patients with ATC, 88 had distant metastasis at diagnosis. The 5-year disease-specific survival was 24% for total ATC and 10% for ATC with distant metastasis. Survival for &gt;1 year was 32% for total ATC and 15% for ATC with distant metastasis. The median survival rate differed significantly between the total ATC and ATC with distant metastasis groups (228.5 vs. 171 days). Among the ATC cases, 11% had brain metastasis; thus, brain MRI or CT is worth considering at diagnosis and follow-up, even if there were no statistical difference in overall survival between patients with ATC with and without brain metastasis.","author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Jin-Seok"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Jun Sung"},{"family":"Yun","given":"Hyeok Jun"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hojin"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Seok Mo"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yong Sang"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hang-Seok"},{"family":"Park","given":"Cheong Soo"}],"citation-key":"leePrognosisAnaplasticThyroid2022","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14235784","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,24]]},"language":"eng","page":"5784","PMCID":"PMC9737297","PMID":"36497268","source":"PubMed","title":"Prognosis of Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer with Distant Metastasis","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},

  {"id":"leesBiologyTherapyPrimary2019","abstract":"Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a distinct disease closely related to classical nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma. Conventional diagnostic paradigms utilising clinical, morphological and immunophenotypical features can be challenging due to overlapping features with other B-cell lymphomas. Reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers that are applicable to the conventional diagnostic laboratory are largely lacking. Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signalling pathways are characteristically dysregulated in PMBCL and implicated in several aspects of disease pathogenesis, and the latter pathway in host immune evasion. The tumour microenvironment is manipulated by PMBCL tumours to avoid T-cell mediated destruction via strategies that include loss of tumour cell antigenicity, T-cell exhaustion and activation of suppressive T-regulatory cells. R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) and DA-EPOCH-R (dose-adjusted etoposide, prednisolone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, rituximab) are the most common first-line immunochemotherapy regimens. End of treatment positron emission tomography scans are the recommended imaging modality and are being evaluated to stratify patients for radiotherapy. Relapsed/refractory disease has a relatively poor outcome despite salvage immunochemotherapy and subsequent autologous stem cell transplantation. Novel therapies are therefore being developed for treatment-resistant disease, targeting aberrant cellular signalling and immune evasion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lees","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Keane","given":"Colm"},{"family":"Gandhi","given":"Maher K."},{"family":"Gunawardana","given":"Jay"}],"citation-key":"leesBiologyTherapyPrimary2019","container-title":"British Journal of Haematology","DOI":"10.1111/bjh.15778","ISSN":"1365-2141","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2019 The Authors British Journal of Haematology published by British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"25-41","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Biology and therapy of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma: current status and future directions","title-short":"Biology and therapy of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjh.15778","volume":"185"},
  {"id":"leeZanidatamabZaniHER2targeted2022","abstract":"4032\n\nBackground: Zani, also known as ZW25, is a novel HER2-targeted bispecific antibody that targets two distinct extracellular domains of HER2. Zani has shown preliminary antitumor activity and tolerability in pts with HER2+ gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma as monotherapy/with chemo in Phase 1/2 studies (NCT02892123, NCT03929666). TIS, an anti-PD-1 antibody, has demonstrated antitumor activity in pts with advanced solid tumors. Combining anti-HER2 therapy with anti-PD-1 therapy and chemo increased tumor response in G/GEJC in a Phase 3 clinical trial. Methods: Cohort 2 of this ongoing open-label, Phase 1b/2 study was in pts with untreated locally advanced/metastatic HER2+ G/GEJC (NCT04276493). Cohort A received zani 30 mg/kg IV, Cohort B received zani 1800 mg IV (weight < 70 kg) or 2400 mg IV (weight ≥ 70 kg), both with TIS 200 mg IV and capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) Q3W. Primary endpoints were safety and investigator (INV)-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included INV-assessed duration of response (DoR), disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results: As of Nov 26, 2021, 33 pts with a median age of 64.0 years (range: 29.0–80.0) were assigned to Cohort A (n=19) or B (n=14). Median study follow-up was 7.7 months (range: 2.1–19.0) and the median number of treatment cycles was 10 (range: 1–28), 20 (60.6%) pts remained on treatment. All pts were efficacy evaluable ([EE], n=33), confirmed ORR was 72.7% (95% CI: 54.5, 86.7). Median PFS was 10.9 months (95% CI: 6.9, NE). Efficacy data are summarized in the Table. All pts experienced ≥ 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 24 (72.7%) pts experienced ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs. All pts experienced treatment related TEAEs (trTEAEs), 20 (60.6%) pts experienced ≥ Grade 3 trTEAEs and trTEAEs leading to death occurred in two (6.1%) pts. Immune-mediated AEs (imAEs) occurred in nine (27.3%) pts, of which seven (21.2%) pts experienced ≥ Grade 3 imAEs. Conclusions: Zani, TIS and CAPOX combination demonstrated a manageable safety profile and antitumor activity as 1L therapy for pts with HER2+ G/GEJC.

  {"id":"lekovicIncreasedRiskVenous2010","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a rare subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, arising in the mediastinum. Compression of large mediastinal vessels is common in patients with PMBCL, predisposing these patients to venous thrombosis. The incidence of this complication is still unknown.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 42 consecutive patients diagnosed with PMBCL at a Clinic for hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia between 1999 and 2009 to identify the frequency and risk factors for venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) and its correlation with survival.\nRESULTS: In the subgroup of patients with thrombosis (VTE subgroup) were 15/42 patients (35.7%): 14 patients had deep venous thrombosis and 1 had pulmonary embolism. Ten patients had a thrombosis at the moment of diagnosis PMBCL, while in five thrombosis occurred during the course of the disease. According to hemostasis variables, patients in the VTE subgroup had significantly higher fibrinogen (P=0.02) and D-Dimer (P<0.001). Also, patients in the VTE subgroup had significantly larger diameter of mediastinal tumor mass (P=0.01) and the incidence of syndrome venae cava superior (P=0.009). The median survival rate in the VTE subgroup was 45 months (95% CI; 22 to 68 months) while in the NVTE it was 93 (95% CI; 46 to 140 months), (log rank P=0.058).\nCONCLUSIONS: VTE is a common complication in PMBCL patients and according to our results negatively influences survival. Use of antithrombotic prophylaxis may be considered together with chemotherapy, especially in those with bulky mediastinal tumor mass.","author":[{"family":"Lekovic","given":"Danijela"},{"family":"Miljic","given":"Predrag"},{"family":"Mihaljevic","given":"Biljana"}],"citation-key":"lekovicIncreasedRiskVenous2010","container-title":"Thrombosis Research","container-title-short":"Thromb Res","DOI":"10.1016/j.thromres.2010.08.017","ISSN":"1879-2472","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"477-480","PMID":"21126629","source":"PubMed","title":"Increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2010.08.017","volume":"126"},

On April 10, 2019, ASCO hosted Closing the Rural Cancer Care Gap, the second event in its State of Cancer Care in America series. The event focused on two aspects of rural cancer care: a review of the major issues and concerns in delivering rural cancer care and a discussion of creative solutions to address rural-nonrural disparities. This article draws from the event and supporting literature to summarize the challenges to delivering high-quality care in rural communities, update ASCO's workforce data on the geographic distribution of oncologists, and highlight 3 institutional approaches to addressing these challenges in diverse rural settings. The experience of the 3 institutions featured in the article suggests that increasing rural patients' access to care requires expanding services and decreasing travel distances, mitigating financial burdens when insurance coverage is limited, opening avenues to clinical trial participation, and creating partnerships between providers and community leaders to address local gaps in care. Because the characteristics of rural communities, health care resources, and patient populations are not homogeneous, rural health disparities require local solutions that are based on community needs, available resources, and trusting and collaborative partnerships.","author":[{"family":"Levit","given":"Laura A."},{"family":"Byatt","given":"Leslie"},{"family":"Lyss","given":"Alan P."},{"family":"Paskett","given":"Electra D."},{"family":"Levit","given":"Kathryn"},{"family":"Kirkwood","given":"Kelsey"},{"family":"Schenkel","given":"Caroline"},{"family":"Schilsky","given":"Richard L."}],"citation-key":"levitClosingRuralCancer2020","container-title":"JCO oncology practice","container-title-short":"JCO Oncol Pract","DOI":"10.1200/OP.20.00174","ISSN":"2688-1535","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"422-430","PMID":"32574128","source":"PubMed","title":"Closing the Rural Cancer Care Gap: Three Institutional Approaches","title-short":"Closing the Rural Cancer Care Gap","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},
  {"id":"liaoAspirinUseTumor2012","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Regular use of aspirin after a diagnosis of colon cancer has been associated with a superior clinical outcome. Experimental evidence suggests that inhibition of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) (also known as cyclooxygenase-2) by aspirin down-regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling activity. We hypothesized that the effect of aspirin on survival and prognosis in patients with cancers characterized by mutated PIK3CA (the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha polypeptide gene) might differ from the effect among those with wild-type PIK3CA cancers.\nMETHODS: We obtained data on 964 patients with rectal or colon cancer from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, including data on aspirin use after diagnosis and the presence or absence of PIK3CA mutation. We used a Cox proportional-hazards model to compute the multivariate hazard ratio for death. We examined tumor markers, including PTGS2, phosphorylated AKT, KRAS, BRAF, microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1.\nRESULTS: Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA colorectal cancers, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was associated with superior colorectal cancer-specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio for cancer-related death, 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.61; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.94; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not associated with colorectal cancer-specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.32; P=0.76 by the log-rank test; P=0.009 for interaction between aspirin and PIK3CA variables) or overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.17; P=0.96 by the log-rank test; P=0.07 for interaction).\nCONCLUSIONS: Regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was associated with longer survival among patients with mutated-PIK3CA colorectal cancer, but not among patients with wild-type PIK3CA cancer. The findings from this molecular pathological epidemiology study suggest that the PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer may serve as a predictive molecular biomarker for adjuvant aspirin therapy.

Recent studies demonstrated that immunotherapy can improve the survival of patients with locally advanced and metastatic ESCC. Furthermore, previous studies reported that the expression of programmed death‑ligand 1 is significantly associated with esophageal cancer prognosis. At present, several ongoing clinical trials have extended the use of immunotherapy from palliative and salvage treatments to neoadjuvant treatment with concurrent chemoradiation. The first‑ or second‑line treatments were used to explore antitumor efficacy with reduced adverse events.

Whereas Billroth may be regarded as the father of modern gastrointestinal surgery, Czerny can be considered the father of modern surgery for intestinal malignancies and multimodal treatment. The early history of visceral cancer therapy is linked with his career. He became a surgeon of the highest rank, with great clinical skill, rare judgment, and vision who contributed essentially to the development of modern surgery. From his early education he maintained a lifelong affection for the natural sciences and was an excellent physiologist and pathologist. During his professional life he successfully built up a well deserved reputation for general and cancer surgery and for the introduction of radio- and chemotherapy into the treatment of tumors. Czerny founded and chaired the first experimental Institute for Cancer Research in Germany. Two years later, in 1908, he presided at the 2nd Congress of the International Society of Surgery/Société Internationale de Chirurgie (ISS/SIC) in Brussels, a congress that was almost entirely devoted to the etiology of visceral cancer and the progress and achievements of its treatment.

The effect of the number of lymph nodes (LNs) removed to treat middle and lower thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in China remains controversial. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the impact of the number of LNs removed during lymphadenectomy on the survival of patients with middle and lower thoracic ESCC. Data were obtained from the Sichuan Cancer Hospital and Institute Esophageal Cancer Case Management Database from January 2010 to April 2020. Either three-field systematic lymphadenectomy (3F group) or two-field systematic lymphadenectomy (2F group) was performed for ESCC cases with or without suspicious tumor-positive cervical LNs, respectively. Subgroups were designed for further analysis based on the quartile number of resected LNs. After 50.7 months of median follow-up, 1,659 patients who underwent esophagectomy were enrolled. The median overall survival (OS) of the 2F and 3F groups was 50.0 months and 58.5 months, respectively. The OS rates at 1, 3 and 5 years were 86, 57 and 47%, respectively, in the 2F group, and 83, 52 and 47%, respectively, in the 3F group (P=0.732). The average OS of the 3F B and D groups was 57.7 months and 30.2 months, respectively (P=0.006). In the 2F group, the OS between subgroups was not significantly different.

  {"id":"liNeoadjuvantImmunotherapyResectable2022","abstract":"Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, especially in China. Despite therapeutic advances, the 5-year survival rate of EC is still dismal. For patients with resectable disease, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) in combination with esophagectomy is the mainstay of treatment. However, the pathological complete response (pCR) rate to nCRT of 29.2% to 43.2% is not satisfactory, and approximately half of the patients will develop either a locoregional recurrence or distant metastasis. It is, therefore, necessary to explore novel and effective treatment strategies to improve the clinical efficacy of treatment. Immunotherapy utilizing immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly changed the treatment paradigm for a wide variety of advanced cancers, including EC. More recently, increasing clinical evidence has demonstrated that neoadjuvant immunotherapy can potentially improve the survival of patients with resectable cancers. Furthermore, accumulating findings support the idea that chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy can activate the immune system through a variety of mechanisms, so a combination of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy with immunotherapy can have a synergistic antitumor effect. Therefore, it is reasonable to evaluate the role of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with surgically resectable EC. In this review, we discuss the rationale for neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with EC, summarize the current results of utilizing this strategy, review the planned and ongoing studies, and highlight the challenges and future research needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Zhenyu"}],"citation-key":"liNeoadjuvantImmunotherapyResectable2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","ISSN":"1664-3224","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable esophageal cancer: A review","title-short":"Neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.1051841","volume":"13"},

However, there is no effective treatment for this disease.\nMETHODS: This study was analyzed using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Joinpoint regression models, linear regression models, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression models were used to study the trends in incidence, survival rate and median survival time and to detect the risk factors affecting prognosis in patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer.\nRESULTS: While the incidence rate and truncated incidence rate fluctuated slightly over the past 30 years, they were relatively stable and had no obvious upward trend (APC = -0.22 and 0.24, respectively, P>0.05). The median survival was 3.16 months, and the survival rate did not improve significantly (the APC values of the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month survival rates were 0.44, 0.35, -0.23 and -0.86, respectively, P>0.05).

Here, we aim to examine correlations in their incidence rates and to compare their temporal changes globally, both overall and by subtype.\nMETHODS: Long-term incidence data were obtained from population-based registries available from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series. Variation in the occurrence of EC and GC (overall and by subtype) was assessed using the GC:EC ratio of sex-specific age-standardised rates (ASR) in 2008-2012. Average annual per cent changes were estimated to assess temporal trends during 1998-2012.\nRESULTS: ASRs for GC and EC varied remarkably across and within world regions. In the countries evaluated, the GC:EC ratio in men exceeded 10 in several South American countries, Algeria and Republic of Korea, while EC dominated in most sub-Saharan African countries. High rates of both cardia gastric cancer and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were observed in several Asian populations. Non-cardia gastric cancer rates correlated positively with ESCC rates (r=0.60) and negatively with EAC (r=-0.79). For the time trends, while GC incidence has been uniformly decreasing by on average 2%-3% annually over 1998-2012 in most countries, trends for EC depend strongly on histology, with several but not all countries experiencing increases in EAC and decreases in ESCC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Correlations between GC and EC incidence rates across populations are positive or inverse depending on the GC subsite and EC subtype.

However, the results of recent studies have been contradictory. Therefore, the aim of this article is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy in neoadjuvant therapy through meta-analysis.\nMETHOD: We comprehensively reviewed the literature and clinical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by February 2022 by searching Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords such as \"esophageal adenocarcinoma\" or \"immunotherapy\" in several databases, including the Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov websites. Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and quality of evidence by using standardized Cochrane Methods procedures. The primary outcomes were 1-year overall survival (OS) and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS), estimated by calculating the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the combined odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR). Secondary outcomes estimated using OR were disease objective response rate (DORR) and incidence of adverse events.\nRESULTS: Four RCTs with a total of 3,013 patients researching the efficacy of immunotherapy plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone on gastrointestinal cancer were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that immune checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy treatment was associated with an increased risk of PFS (HR = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.70-0.83]; p < 0.001), OS (HR = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.74-0.89]; p < 0.001), and DORR (relative ratio (RR) = 1.31 [95% CI: 1.19-1.44]; p < 0.0001) when compared with chemotherapy alone in advanced, unresectable, and metastatic EAC/GEA. However, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy increased the incidence of adverse reactions such as alanine aminotransferase elevation (OR = 1.55 [95% CI: 1.17-2.07]; p = 0.003) and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) syndrome (OR = 1.30 [95% CI: 1.05-1.63]; p = 0.02). Nausea (OR = 1.24 [95% CI: 1.07-1.44]; p = 0.005) and white blood cell count decreased (OR = 1.40 [95% CI: 1.13-1.73]; p = 0.002), and so on. Fortunately, toxicities were within acceptable limits. Meanwhile, for patients with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥1, compared with chemotherapy alone, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy had a better overall survival rate (HR = 0.81 [95% CI: 0.73-0.90]; p = 0.0001).\nCONCLUSION: Our study shows that immunotherapy plus chemotherapy has an obvious benefit for patients with previously untreated, unresectable advanced, or metastatic EAC/GEA when compared with chemotherapy alone. However, a high risk of adverse reactions may occur during immunotherapy plus chemotherapy, and more studies focusing on the treatment strategies of untreated, unresectable advanced, or metastatic EAC/GEA are warranted.\nSYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: www.crd.york.ac.uk, identifier CRD42022319434.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Bo-Wei"},{"family":"Shang","given":"Qi-Xing"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yu-Shang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Long-Qi"}],"citation-key":"liuEfficacySafetyPD12023","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2023.1077675","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1077675","PMCID":"PMC10129365","PMID":"37114136","source":"PubMed","title":"Efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in the treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in the treatment of advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

Patients who have not progressed after CCRT received sintilimab as maintenance once every 3 weeks up to 1 year. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and safety. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR).\nRESULTS: Between September 2019 and March 2022, in a total of 36 enrolled patients, 34 pts completed CCRT. Three patients excluded due to violation of the exclusion criteria (1 pt) and consent withdrawal (2 pts). Finally, 33 pts were included in the final analysis, in which 3 pts had disease progression, and the remaining 30 entered maintenance therapy with sintilimab. The median follow-up time was 12.3 months. Median OS was 20.6 months (95%CI 10.5-NA) and the 1-year OS rate was 64%. Median PFS was 11.5 months (95%CI 5.29-21.3) and the 1-year PFS rate was 43.6%. The ORR was 63.6% (95%CI 44.6-77.8), including 2 cases of CR and 19 cases of PR. The DCR was 19.9%, the median DOR was 19.5 months, and the median TTR was 2.4 months. The rate of any grade TRAEs was 96.7%; ≥Grade 3 TRAE was 23.4%. The incidence of immune-related AE was 60%, most of which were grade 1-2, and only one case of thyroid-stimulating hormone increased was irAE with grade 3 or above.\nCONCLUSION: Sintilimab has shown promising clinical efficacy and a manageable safety profile as maintenance therapy after CCRT for local/regional recurrent esophageal squamous carcinoma. In addition, further confirmation from a large-scale real-world study is still needed.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Chengxin"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Hongfu"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhongtang"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Chengrui"},{"family":"Han","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xue"},{"family":"Li","given":"Baosheng"}],"citation-key":"liuSintilimabMaintenanceTreatment2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Immunology","container-title-short":"Front Immunol","DOI":"10.3389/fimmu.2023.1193394","ISSN":"1664-3224","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1193394","PMCID":"PMC10264589","PMID":"37325650","source":"PubMed","title":"Sintilimab as maintenance treatment for local/regional recurrent esophageal squamous carcinoma after concurrent chemoradiotherapy: a single-arm Ib/II phase study","title-short":"Sintilimab as maintenance treatment for local/regional recurrent esophageal squamous carcinoma after concurrent chemoradiotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"locatiCurrentPictureAnaplastic2023","abstract":"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare cancer accounting for 40% of thyroid cancer-specific deaths. In the last 5 years, improved insights into molecular pathways led the Food and Drug Administration to license BRAF/MEK inhibitors (B/Mi) in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC, and pembrolizumab in solid cancer with high tumour mutational burden (TMB-H) (≥10 mutations/megabase) (mut/Mb). In Europe, clinicians face challenges in prescribing novel treatments, as the European Medical Association (EMA) has not licensed B/Mi nor immunotherapy (IO) for ATC so far. Some patients manage to receive these drugs through alternative ways. We investigated the extent of this phenomenon launching an online survey from March 12th to 19th 2021 open to 239 Institutions in the EORTC Endocrine and Head & Neck Cancer Groups. Questions enquired about the number of ATC patients evaluated/year, feasibility of BRAF assessment, accessibility to B/Mi-IO, availability of clinical trials and interest in new studies. Colleagues from 94 Institutions (20 Countries) joined: 30 centres evaluated ≥5 ATC patients/year, with an overall incidence >200 patients/year. 80.8% tested BRAF status, 43.6% by next-generation sequencing. 62.7% and 70% of responders reported limitations in prescribing B/Mi and IO, respectively: either the impossibility of offering them, or drugs accessibility exclusively under certain conditions (e.g. health insurance, clinical trials, compassionate use, off-label). Only 13.8% had clinical trials ongoing while 91.5% of sites claimed ATC-dedicated trials. Disparities in access to novel treatments are diffuse. Access to cutting-edge therapies is an urgent issue in this setting, and clinical trials seem feasible within an appropriate network.","author":[{"family":"Locati","given":"Laura D."},{"family":"Colombo","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Dedecjus","given":"Marek"},{"family":"Fouchardière","given":"Christelle","non-dropping-particle":"de la"},{"family":"Sents","given":"Ward"},{"family":"Bongiovanni","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Netea-Maier","given":"Romana"}],"citation-key":"locatiCurrentPictureAnaplastic2023","container-title":"European Journal of Cancer (Oxford, England: 1990)","container-title-short":"Eur J Cancer","DOI":"10.1016/j.ejca.2022.12.002","ISSN":"1879-0852","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"146-154","PMID":"36599182","source":"PubMed","title":"Current picture of anaplastic thyroid cancer patients' care and meetable needs: A survey of 94 Institutions from the EORTC Endocrine and Head and Neck Cancer Groups","title-short":"Current picture of anaplastic thyroid cancer patients' care and meetable needs","type":"article-journal","volume":"180"},

  {"id":"lorimerDabrafenibTrametinibTherapy2023","abstract":"AIMS: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare but aggressive form of thyroid cancer with a median survival of 4 months. Recent advances in molecular profiling have shown that up to half of ATCs harbour the BRAF-V600E mutation. The aim of this study was to provide real-world data and experience on the use of combination therapy dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with BRAF-V600E-mutated advanced ATC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated patients with confirmed BRAF-V600E-mutated ATC, defined as patients with locally advanced or metastatic ATC with no locoregional, radical treatment options. Outcomes measured were overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, discontinuation rate, dose reduction rate and toxicity data.\nRESULTS: Seventeen patients were evaluated and the mean age was 68 years. Ten patients died by the time of censoring. The median duration of follow-up was 12 months (3-43 months). The estimated median overall survival was 6.9 months (95% confidence interval 2.46 months - upper confidence interval not reached) and the median progression-free survival was 4.7 months (95% confidence interval 1.4-7.8 months). Dose interruptions and/or reductions were common, but none of the patients had to permanently discontinue treatment because of toxicities. Severe toxicities (grades 3 and 4) were uncommon.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study supports the indication of dabrafenib and trametinib in BRAF-V600E-mutated ATC as an effective and well-tolerated treatment in an historically difficult to treat cancer.","author":[{"family":"Lorimer","given":"C."},{"family":"Cheng","given":"L."},{"family":"Chandler","given":"R."},{"family":"Garcez","given":"K."},{"family":"Gill","given":"V."},{"family":"Graham","given":"K."},{"family":"Grant","given":"W."},{"family":"Sardo Infirri","given":"S."},{"family":"Wadsley","given":"J."},{"family":"Wall","given":"L."},{"family":"Webber","given":"N."},{"family":"Wong","given":"K.

  {"id":"luoImmuneCheckpointProtein2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma (TC), such as anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (PDTC), and locally advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), have poor prognoses and require novel treatments. Immune checkpoint (ICP) inhibitors have demonstrated encouraging and good results; nevertheless, their effect in advanced TCs remains largely unclear. Thus, we demonstrated ICP profiles and investigated their potential clinical significance.\nMETHODS: A total of 234 TC patients were involved, with 22 ATCs, 44 PDTCs, and 168 PTCs, including 58 advanced PTCs. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate nine ICPs [programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1), Programmed cell death 1 (PD1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), T-cell immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) domain (TIGIT), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA), B7 homolog 3 (B7-H3), and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain- 3 protein (TIM3)] expression via tissue microarrays (TMAs), and clinical correlations were analyzed simultaneously.\nRESULTS: ATC had the highest positive rate of ICPs among the three pathological types, as well as relatively high ICP co-expression. ATC with high expression of PDL1 positivity had a poor prognosis. Shorter survival was associated with VISTA, B7H3, TIM3, and TIGIT expression in PDTC. The greater the co-expression of these four ICPs, the poorer the prognosis in PDTC patients. VISTA and B7H3 were the two most commonly expressed ICPs in advanced PTC, both of which were linked to a poor prognosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: PDL1 is linked to the overall survival (OS) of ATC. A subset of PDTC is likely immunogenic with poor prognosis and co-expression of VISTA, B7H3, TIM3, and TIGIT. Furthermore, VISTA and B7H3 are prognostic biomarkers in advanced PTC. Single or combined blockade targeting these ICPs might be effective for advanced TCs in the future.","author":[{"family":"Luo","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yi-Chen"},{"family":"Shen","given":"Cen-Kai"},{"family":"Ma","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Wei-Bo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qi-Feng"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Liao","given":"Tian"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Wen-Jun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yu"}],"citation-key":"luoImmuneCheckpointProtein2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2022.859013","ISSN":"1664-2392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"859013","PMCID":"PMC9094437","PMID":"35574031","source":"PubMed","title":"Immune Checkpoint Protein Expression Defines the Prognosis of Advanced Thyroid Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"13"},

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lobaplatin-based induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy over a cisplatin-based regimen in patients with locoregional, advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\nMethods\nIn this open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at five hospitals in China, patients aged 18–60 years with previously untreated, non-keratinising stage III–IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Karnofsky performance-status score of at least 70; and adequate haematological, renal, and hepatic function were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenously either lobaplatin-based (lobaplatin 30 mg/m2 on days 1 and 22, and fluorouracil 800 mg/m2 on days 1–5 and 22–26 for two cycles) or cisplatin-based (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 22, and fluorouracil 800 mg/m2 on days 1–5 and 22–26 for two cycles) induction chemotherapy, followed by concurrent lobaplatin-based (two cycles of intravenous lobaplatin 30 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy) or cisplatin-based (two cycles of intravenous cisplatin 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy) chemoradiotherapy. Total radiation doses of 68–70 Gy (for the sum of the volumes of the primary tumour and enlarged retropharyngeal nodes), 62–68 Gy (for the volume of clinically involved gross cervical lymph nodes), 60 Gy (for the high-risk target volume), and 54 Gy (for the low-risk target volume), were administered in 30–32 fractions, 5 days per week. Randomisation was done centrally at the clinical trial centre of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Centre by means of computer-generated random number allocation with a block design (block size of four) stratified according to disease stage and treatment centre. Treatment assignment was known to both clinicians and patients. The primary endpoint was 5-year progression-free survival, analysed in both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations. If the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in 5-year progression-free survival between the lobaplatin-based and cisplatin-based groups did not exceed 10%, non-inferiority was met. Adverse events were analysed in all patients who received at least one cycle of induction chemotherapy. This trial is registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-TRC-13003285 and is closed.\nFindings\nFrom June 7, 2013, to June 16, 2015, 515 patients were assessed for eligibility and 502 patients were enrolled: 252 were randomly assigned to the lobaplatin-based group and 250 to the cisplatin-based group. After a median follow-up of 75·3 months (IQR 69·9–81·1) in the intention-to-treat population, 5-year progression-free survival was 75·0% (95% CI 69·7–80·3) in the lobaplatin-based group and 75·5% (70·0 to 81·0) in the cisplatin-based group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·98, 95% CI 0·69–1·39; log-rank p=0·92), with a difference of 0·5% (95% CI −7·1 to 8·1; pnon-inferiority=0·0070). In the per-protocol population, the 5-year progression-free survival was 74·8% (95% CI 69·3 to 80·3) in the lobaplatin-based group and 76·4% (70·9 to 81·9) in the cisplatin-based group (HR 1·04, 95% CI 0·73 to 1·49; log-rank p=0·83), with a difference of 1·6% (−6·1 to 9·3; pnon-inferiority=0·016). 63 (25%) of 252 patients in the lobaplatin-based group and 63 (25%) of 250 patients in the cisplatin-based group had a progression-free survival event in the intention-to-treat population; 62 (25%) of 246 patients in the lobaplatin-based group and 58 (25%) of 237 patients in the cisplatin-based group had a progression-free survival event in the per-protocol population. The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were mucositis (102 [41%] of 252 in the lobaplatin-based group vs 99 [40%] of 249 in the cisplatin-based group), leucopenia (39 [16%] vs 56 [23%]), and neutropenia (25 [10%] vs 59 [24%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.\nInterpretation\nLobaplatin-based induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than cisplatin-based therapy. The results of our trial indicate that lobaplatin-based induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy might be a promising alternative regimen to cisplatin-based treatment in patients with locoregional, advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.\nFunding\nNational Science and Technology Pillar Program, International Cooperation Project of Science and Technology Program of Guangdong Province, Planned Science and Technology Project of Guangdong Province, and Cultivation Foundation for the Junior Teachers at Sun Yat-sen University.\nTranslation\nFor the Chinese translation of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Lv","given":"Xing"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Xun"},{"family":"Xia","given":"Wei-Xiong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Kui-Yuan"},{"family":"Qiang","given":"Meng-Yun"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Ling"},{"family":"Qian","given":"Chao-Nan"},{"family":"Cao","given":"Ka-Jia"},{"family":"Mo","given":"Hao-Yuan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xian-Ming"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zi-Huang"},{"family":"Han","given":"Fei"},{"family":"He","given":"Yu-Xiang"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Yu-Meng"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shao-Xiong"},{"family":"Bai","given":"Yong-Rui"},{"family":"Ke","given":"Liang-Ru"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Wen-Ze"},{"family":"Liang","given":"Hu"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Guo-Ying"},{"family":"Miao","given":"Jing-Jing"},{"family":"Li","given":"Wang-Zhong"},{"family":"Lv","given":"Shu-Hui"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xi"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Chong"},{"family":"Xiang","given":"Yan-Qun"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Xiang"}],"citation-key":"lvInductionChemotherapyLobaplatin2021","container-title":"The Lancet Oncology","container-title-short":"The Lancet Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/S1470-2045(21)00075-9","ISSN":"1470-2045","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"716-726","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Induction chemotherapy with lobaplatin and fluorouracil versus cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III–IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma: an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial","title-short":"Induction chemotherapy with lobaplatin and fluorouracil versus cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage III–IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204521000759","volume":"22"},

  {"id":"maglakelidzeHERIZONPhaseStudy2023","abstract":"289\n\nBackground: Active immunization with the B-lymphocyte stimulating HER2 vaccine, HER-Vaxx (IMU-131), has shown clinical response correlated with HER2-specific antibodies (Wiedermann et. al., Clinical Cancer Research, 2021). The HER-Vaxx HERIZON study is based on the landmark ToGA study (Bang et. al., The Lancet, 2010) and included patients with HER2/neu over-expressing metastatic or advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma who were naïve to HER2 therapy. Methods: Thirty-six patients were randomized to either HER-Vaxx plus standard chemotherapy or standard chemotherapy alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy treated patients received 50 µg dose of HER-Vaxx by intra-muscular injection at Days 0, 14, 35, 77 and every 63 days until disease progression. Both groups received chemotherapy starting at Day 0 and then every 21 days for a maximum of 6 cycles or until disease progression. Standard chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin + 5FU or capecitabine, or oxaliplatin + capecitabine. Statistical analysis pre-specified a 1-sided false positive probability of 0.10. Results: Of 36 patients randomized (19 treated with HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy and 17 with chemotherapy alone), 32 patients had a survival event (15 and 17 respectively) at the time of final analysis. All patients received oxaliplatin + capecitabine chemotherapy. Analysis showed a 42% survival benefit for patients treated with HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone. This translated into an OS HR of 0.580 (80% 2-sided CI: 0.362, 0.927) with a statistically significant p-value of 0.066. The median OS for patients receiving HER-Vaxx plus chemotherapy was 13.9 (7.5, 14.3) months, compared to 8.3 (6.0, 9.6) months in patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Median duration of response was 30 vs 19 weeks in favor of the HER-Vaxx arm. There was no difference in safety between the two treatment arms, indicating HER-Vaxx does not add toxicity to standard chemotherapy. HER-Vaxx induced persistent HER2 specific antibodies which correlated with clinical response. Additional response parameters including DOR and biomarker data will be presented at the meeting. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that in patients with HER2 over-expressing gastric/GEJ cancer active HER2 immunization with HER-Vaxx is safe and provides relevant clinical benefit over standard of care chemotherapy.

  {"id":"maipangInductionChemotherapyTreatment1994","abstract":"A prospective randomized phase III trial was carried out at Songklanagarind Hospital from August 1988 to December 1990. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy regimen in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and to determine whether induction chemotherapy improves symptom-free period and survival in these patients compared to surgical treatment alone. Twenty-four patients were randomized to receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy, cis-platinum 100 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, bleomycin 10 mg/m2 loading dose on day 3, followed by 10 mg/m2/day continuous intravenous infusion on days 4 through 7, and vinblastine 3 mg/m2 given intravenously on days 1, 8, 15, 22. The cycle was repeated on day 29. Fifteen patients completed 2 courses of chemotherapy and among these, 2 patients had a complete clinical response (13%), 6 (40%) had a partial response, and 7 patients (47%) had no response. Four patients died during chemotherapy treatment. Grade 3 hematologic toxicity (ECOG criteria) was observed in 47% (7/15) of patients. Twenty-two patients were randomized to conventional treatment (surgery alone). Median survival time was 17 months in both groups. However, early survival appeared to be better in the control group. Kaplan-Meier survivals at 6 months were 69% and 89% and at 3 years were 31% and 36% for the induction chemotherapy group and control group, respectively. The survival time differences were not statistically significant (P = 0.186). These findings demonstrate that although this chemotherapy regimen had some effect on squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus, it did not improve survival. On the contrary, survival seems to be better in the control group. The 6-month survival discrepancy between both groups might be due to the poor nutritional status of our patients, who may better tolerate smaller dosages of chemotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Maipang","given":"T."},{"family":"Vasinanukorn","given":"P."},{"family":"Petpichetchian","given":"C."},{"family":"Chamroonkul","given":"S."},{"family":"Geater","given":"A."},{"family":"Chansawwaang","given":"S."},{"family":"Kuapanich","given":"R."},{"family":"Panjapiyakul","given":"C."},{"family":"Watanaarepornchai","given":"S."},{"family":"Punperk","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"maipangInductionChemotherapyTreatment1994","container-title":"Journal of Surgical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Surg Oncol","DOI":"10.1002/jso.2930560314","ISSN":"0022-4790","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"191-197","PMID":"7518020","source":"PubMed","title":"Induction chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with carcinoma of the esophagus","type":"article-journal","volume":"56"},

  {"id":"maltyComputerizedApproachCreating2018","abstract":"PURPOSE: The systemic treatment of cancer is primarily through the administration of complex chemotherapy protocols. To date, this knowledge has not been systematized, because of the lack of a consistent nomenclature and the variation in which regimens are documented. For example, recording of treatment events in electronic health record notes is often through shorthand and acronyms, limiting secondary use. A standardized hierarchic ontology of cancer treatments, mapped to standard nomenclatures, would be valuable to a variety of end users.\nMETHODS: We leveraged the knowledge contained in a large wiki of hematology/oncology drugs and treatment regimens, HemOnc.org. Through algorithmic parsing, we created a hierarchic ontology of treatment concepts in the World Wide Web Consortium Web Ontology Language. We also mapped drug names to RxNorm codes and created optional filters to restrict the ontology by disease and/or drug class.\nRESULTS: As of December 2017, the main ontology includes 30,526 axioms (eg, doxorubicin is an anthracycline), 1,196 classes (eg, regimens used in the neoadjuvant treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer, nitrogen mustards), and 1,728 individual entities. More than 13,000 of the axioms are annotations including RxNorm codes, drug synonyms, literature references, and direct links to published articles.\nCONCLUSION: This approach represents, to our knowledge, the largest effort to date to systematically categorize and relate hematology/oncology drugs and regimens. The ontology can be used to reason individual components from regimens mentioned in electronic health records (eg, R-CHOP maps to rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and also to probabilistically reconstruct regimens from individual drug components. These capabilities may be particularly valuable in the implementation of rapid-learning health systems on the basis of real-world evidence.

Patients with histopathological confirmation of ATC from January 2000 to October 2019 were included and divided into 3 groups according to date of presentation: 2000-2013, 2014-2016, and 2017-2019.Overall survival compared among different treatment eras and differing therapies, including targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and surgery.Of 479 patients (246 men [51%]; median age, 65.0 [range, 21.1-92.6] years) with ATC evaluated, 52 (11%) were stage IVA, 172 (36%) stage IVB, and 255 (53%) stage IVC at presentation. The median OS of the entire cohort was 0.79 years (9.5 months), ranging from 0.01 to 16.63. The OS at 1 and 2 years was 35% (95% CI, 29%-42%) and 18% (95% CI, 13%-23%) in the 2000-2013 group (n = 227), 47% (95% CI, 36%-56%) and 25% (95% CI, 17%-34%) in the 2014-2016 group (n = 100), and 59% (95% CI, 49%-67%) and 42% (95% CI, 30%-53%) in the 2017-2019 group (n = 152), respectively (P &lt; .001).

Factors associated with improved OS included targeted therapy (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.39-0.63; P &lt; .001), the addition of immunotherapy to targeted therapy (hazard ratio, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.36-0.94; P = .03), and surgery following neoadjuvant BRAF-directed therapy (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.78; P = .02). Patients undergoing surgery following neoadjuvant BRAF-directed therapy (n = 20) had a 94% 1-year survival with a median follow-up of 1.21 years.In this large single-institution cohort study spanning nearly 20 years, changes in patient management appear to be associated with significant increase in survival.

  {"id":"mantziariEsophagealCancerElderly2021","abstract":"Esophageal cancer, despite its tendency to increase among younger patients, remains a disease of the elderly, with the peak incidence between 70–79 years. In spite of that, elderly patients are still excluded from major clinical trials and they are frequently offered suboptimal treatment even for curable stages of the disease. In this review, a clear survival benefit is demonstrated for elderly patients treated with neoadjuvant treatment, surgery, and even definitive chemoradiation compared to palliative or no treatment. Surgery in elderly patients is often associated with higher morbidity and mortality compared to younger patients and may put older frail patients at increased risk of autonomy loss. Definitive chemoradiation is the predominant modality offered to elderly patients, with very promising results especially for squamous cell cancer, although higher rates of acute toxicity might be encountered. Based on the all the above, and although the best available evidence comes from retrospective studies, it is not justified to refrain from curative treatment for elderly patients based on their age alone. Thorough assessment and an adapted treatment plan as well as inclusion of elderly patients in ongoing clinical trials will allow better understanding and management of esophageal cancer in this heterogeneous and often frail population.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Mantziari","given":"Styliani"},{"family":"Teixeira Farinha","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Bouygues","given":"Vianney"},{"family":"Vignal","given":"Jean-Charles"},{"family":"Deswysen","given":"Yannick"},{"family":"Demartines","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Piessen","given":"Guillaume"}],"citation-key":"mantziariEsophagealCancerElderly2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13092104","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"9","page":"2104","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Esophageal Cancer in Elderly Patients, Current Treatment Options and Outcomes; A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/9/2104","volume":"13"},

The tumors of all patients were confined to the mucosal layer without ulceration and without lymph node metastasis. The tumor diameter was not more than 2.5 cm. Endoscopy, endoscopic ultrasound, and computed tomography scan were performed 1–3 months after the treatment, and a biopsy was performed to evaluate the effects of the therapy. Long-term endoscopic follow-up was maintained. Complete eradication was achieved in all the 20 patients, including four patients with high-grade dysplasia associated with focal canceration, seven patients with well-differentiated squamous cell cancer, and nine patients with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, resulting in a complete response rate of 100 % at 1–3 months after treatment. No recurrence was found during 36–73 months of follow-up in all 20 patients. No operative or delayed complications were observed in any of the 20 patients. Preliminary study shows that endoscopic Ho:YAG laser ablation may be an effective, safe, and minimally invasive method for selected patients with early GI intramucosal cancer. Further research is required to confirm the safety and efficacy of this technique compared to its alternative techniques in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Mao","given":"Yongping"},{"family":"Qiu","given":"Haixia"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Qingsen"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Zhongsheng"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Kaichun"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yingcai"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yunsheng"}],"citation-key":"maoEndoscopicHolmiumYAG2013","container-title":"Lasers in Medical Science","container-title-short":"Lasers Med Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10103-013-1267-8","ISSN":"0268-8921, 1435-604X","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",11]]},"language":"en","page":"1505-1509","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Endoscopic holmium:YAG laser ablation of early gastrointestinal intramucosal cancer","title-short":"Endoscopic holmium","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10103-013-1267-8","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"masseyAssessingEventualPublication2016","abstract":"Despite the ethical imperative to publish clinical trials when human subjects are involved, such data frequently remain unpublished. The objectives were to tabulate the rate and ascertain factors associated with eventual publication of clinical trial results reported as abstracts in the Proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (American Society of Clinical Oncology).Abstracts describing clinical trials for patients with breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer from 2009 to 2011 were identified by using a comprehensive online database (http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/abstracts). Abstracts included reported results of a treatment or intervention assessed in a discrete, prospective clinical trial. Publication status at 4−6 years was determined by using a standardized search of PubMed. Primary outcomes were the rate of publication for abstracts of randomized and nonrandomized clinical trials. Secondary outcomes included factors influencing the publication of results.A total of 1,075 abstracts describing 378 randomized and 697 nonrandomized clinical trials were evaluated. Across all years, 75% of randomized and 54% of nonrandomized trials were published, with an overall publication rate of 61%. Sample size was a statistically significant predictor of publication for both randomized and nonrandomized trials (odds ratio [OR] per increase of 100 participants = 1.23 [1.11–1.36], p &lt; .001; and 1.64 [1.15–2.34], p = .006, respectively). Among randomized studies, an industry coauthor or involvement of a cooperative group increased the likelihood of publication (OR 2.37, p = .013; and 2.21, p = .01, respectively). Among nonrandomized studies, phase II trials were more likely to be published than phase I (p &lt; .001). Use of an experimental agent was not a predictor of publication in randomized (OR 0.76 [0.38–1.52]; p = .441) or nonrandomized trials (OR 0.89 [0.61–1.29]; p = .532).This is the largest reported study examining why oncology trials are not published. The data show that 4−6 years after appearing as abstracts, 39% of oncology clinical trials remain unpublished. Larger sample size and advanced trial phase were associated with eventual publication; among randomized trials, an industry-affiliated author or a cooperative group increased likelihood of publication. Unfortunately, we found that, despite widespread recognition of the problem and the creation of central data repositories, timely publishing of oncology clinical trials results remains unsatisfactory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Massey","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruibin"},{"family":"Prasad","given":"Vinay"},{"family":"Bates","given":"Susan E."},{"family":"Fojo","given":"Tito"}],"citation-key":"masseyAssessingEventualPublication2016","container-title":"The Oncologist","container-title-short":"The Oncologist","DOI":"10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0516","ISSN":"1083-7159","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3,1]]},"page":"261-268","source":"Silverchair","title":"Assessing the Eventual Publication of Clinical Trial Abstracts Submitted to a Large Annual Oncology Meeting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1634/theoncologist.2015-0516","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"matsudaLymphNodeMetastatic2023","abstract":"Abundant lymphatic flow and the anatomical location of the esophagus can result in the widespread distribution of lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer from the cervical to the abdominal field. Historically, the Japan Esophageal Society and American Joint Committee on Cancer offer two different classifications of lymph node group location surrounding the esophagus. The location of sentinel lymph nodes in midthoracic esophageal cancer reflects the variety of lymphatic drainage routes. In fact, in cT1N0 esophageal cancer, pathological lymph node metastasis has been observed from the cervical to the abdominal field, and the locations were shown to be closely linked to the primary tumor location in advanced stages. While the impact of histology on the distribution of LN metastasis has been extensively debated, a recent prospective study on esophagogastric junction cancer found that metastatic patterns did not differ by histology. Thoracic duct lymph nodes were defined as one of the regional lymph node stations in the mediastinum. Although lymph node metastasis around the thoracic duct has occasionally been observed, the oncologic impact of thoracic duct lymph node dissection has not been fully elucidated. To eradicate tumors locoregionally, three-field lymph node dissection, a strategy for extended lymph node clearance, has been established. In esophagectomy, three-field lymph node dissection is defined as a procedure for complete regional cervico-thoraco-abdominal lymph node dissection. However, its therapeutic efficacy must be evaluated based on the balance between oncological outcomes and possible added surgical risk. To further improve survival, multidisciplinary treatment consisting of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy has been established worldwide as a standard treatment for esophageal cancer. Now that neoadjuvant therapy followed by esophagectomy is the standard, adding adjuvant therapy including immunotherapy could be a promising treatment option. The ideal combination of various multidisciplinary treatment approaches and extensive LN dissection need to be established to improve the oncological outcomes for EC patients.","author":[{"family":"Matsuda","given":"Satoru"},{"family":"Takeuchi","given":"Masashi"},{"family":"Kawakubo","given":"Hirofumi"},{"family":"Kitagawa","given":"Yuko"}],"citation-key":"matsudaLymphNodeMetastatic2023","container-title":"Diseases of the Esophagus: Official Journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus","container-title-short":"Dis Esophagus","DOI":"10.1093/dote/doad006","ISSN":"1442-2050","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,30]]},"language":"eng","page":"doad006","PMCID":"PMC10061432","PMID":"36857594","source":"PubMed","title":"Lymph node metastatic patterns and the development of multidisciplinary treatment for esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},
  {"id":"maurerMutationbasedShorttermNeoadjuvant2023","abstract":"INTRODUCTION: Few available data indicate that a mutation-based \"neoadjuvant\" therapy in advanced anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) might convert an initially unresectable primary tumor to resectable and optimize local tumor control. We evaluated a preoperative short-term \"neoadjuvant\" therapy with a BRAF-directed therapy or, in case of BRAF non-mutated tumors, an mKI/checkpoint inhibitor combination in three patients with ATC stage IVB and C.\nMETHODS: In the context of preoperative diagnostics, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assessment and genetic analysis was started as soon as possible. The antiangiogenetic therapy with lenvatinib was immediately after diagnosis of ATC started as bridging therapy. In case of a BRAF-mutated ATC, a combination therapy of dabrafenib and trametinib, in case of BRAF-wildtype ATC a combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib was given for 4 weeks. If re-staging has shown a significant therapy response due to a decrease in size of > 50%, surgical resection was reconsidered. A primary tumor resection was performed first. As a second step, limited distant metastasis have been resected approximately 4 weeks after thyroid surgery. After postoperative recovery, the targeted systemic therapy was continued.\nPATIENTS: Two patients presented with BRAF-wildtype ATC stage IVC, one with BRAF-mutated ATC stage IVB. All patients were evaluated by surgery, nuclear medicine and oncology upon diagnosis of ATC.\nRESULTS: In all three cases, the \"neoadjuvant\" therapy induced a dramatic response and led to local resectability in primarily non-resectable ATC stage IVB or C. We have chosen for the first time a short-term \"neoadjuvant\" treatment period to reduce the risk of bleeding and/or fistula due to potential rapid tumor shrinkage. The results of surgery after only short-term \"neoadjuvant\" therapy showed two R0 und one R1 resections. Postoperative histopathological findings confirmed an extent of tumor necrosis or regressive fibrotic tissue between 60 and > 95% in our patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: A short-term mutation-based \"neoadjuvant\" therapy can achieve local resectability in initially unresectable ATC stage IVB or C. A neoadjuvant treatment period of about 4 weeks seems to show similar response as a treatment duration of at least 3 months.","author":[{"family":"Maurer","given":"Elisabeth"},{"family":"Eilsberger","given":"F."},{"family":"Wächter","given":"S."},{"family":"Riera Knorrenschild","given":"J."},{"family":"Pehl","given":"A."},{"family":"Holzer","given":"K."},{"family":"Neubauer","given":"A."},{"family":"Luster","given":"M."},{"family":"Bartsch","given":"D.

These are called iso-agglutinins because of their specific action on cells from the blood of a subject of the same species and must be differentiated from hetero-agglutinins, which produce similar reactions between the bloods of subjects of different species. On the basis of these iso-agglutinins the four blood groups are distinguished.Certain errors in determining blood groups occasionally have arisen because of pseudo-agglutination or excessive rouleaux formation (Shattock,2 1900). This condition is common in cases of acute infection and is apparently due to increased viscosity of the serum. Marked rouleaux formation may cause clumping which simulates true agglutination.

Increased utilization of novel, personalized therapies based upon the tumour's somatic mutation status has recently been integrated. The aim of this case series is to describe a series of patients that underwent rapid genomic testing upon their diagnosis of ATC, allowing for the early integration of novel therapies.\nDESIGN: A fast track pathway for genomic tumour analysis of patients with ATC was implemented at a single academic cancer hospital in January of 2020.\nPATIENTS: All patients were evaluated by head and neck surgery, endocrinology, and medical oncology upon diagnosis of ATC.\nMEASUREMENTS: Genetic work-up was completed, which prompted a recommendation for dual BRAF/MEK inhibition with dabrafenib and trametinib for tumours with BRAF V600E mutation. For patients whose tumours were BRAF V600E wild-type, pembrolizumab with lenvatinib was offered.\nRESULTS: A total of four patients were included in this series. Two patients (50%) had tumours that were BRAF V600E positive. Among patients that were BRAF V600E positive, both patients initiated urgent dabrafenib and trametinib dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy; with one patient demonstrating near-complete clinical response allowing for posttreatment surgery, while the other demonstrated decreased tumour burden.

Overall (acute and late) severe (grade 3-5) toxicity did not differ significantly between treatment groups at 24 months (mean number of events per patient 4·8 [95% CI 4·2-5·4] with cisplatin vs 4·8 [4·2-5·4] with cetuximab; p=0·98). At 24 months, overall all-grade toxicity did not differ significantly either (mean number of events per patient 29·2 [95% CI 27·3-31·0] with cisplatin vs 30·1 [28·3-31·9] with cetuximab; p=0·49). However, there was a significant difference between cisplatin and cetuximab in 2-year overall survival (97·5% vs 89·4%, hazard ratio 5·0 [95% CI 1·7-14·7]; p=0·001) and 2-year recurrence (6·0% vs 16·1%, 3·4 [1·6-7·2]; p=0·0007).\nINTERPRETATION: Compared with the standard cisplatin regimen, cetuximab showed no benefit in terms of reduced toxicity, but instead showed significant detriment in terms of tumour control. Cisplatin and radiotherapy should be used as the standard of care for HPV-positive low-risk patients who are able to tolerate cisplatin.\nFUNDING: Cancer Research UK.","author":[{"family":"Mehanna","given":"Hisham"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Max"},{"family":"Hartley","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Kong","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Foran","given":"Bernadette"},{"family":"Fulton-Lieuw","given":"Tessa"},{"family":"Dalby","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Mistry","given":"Pankaj"},{"family":"Sen","given":"Mehmet"},{"family":"O'Toole","given":"Lorcan"},{"family":"Al Booz","given":"Hoda"},{"family":"Dyker","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Moleron","given":"Rafael"},{"family":"Whitaker","given":"Stephen"},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Sinead"},{"family":"Cook","given":"Audrey"},{"family":"Griffin","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Aynsley","given":"Eleanor"},{"family":"Rolles","given":"Martin"},{"family":"De Winton","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Srinivasan","given":"Devraj"},{"family":"Nixon","given":"Ioanna"},{"family":"Grumett","given":"Joanne"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

Apatinib, a selective inhibitor of VEGFR2, has a synergistic effect with immunotherapy. We aimed to assess the combination of camrelizumab and apatinib as second-line treatment for advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\nMethods\nThis single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study was conducted at eight centres in China. Eligible patients were aged 18–75 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, who had unresectable locally advanced, locally recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and had progressed after or were intolerant to first-line chemotherapy. Patients received intravenous camrelizumab 200 mg once every 2 weeks plus oral apatinib 250 mg once daily for a 28-day cycle until disease progression, unacceptable adverse events, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed confirmed objective response rate. Efficacy was analysed in patients who had received at least one dose of study drug, and safety was analysed in patients who received the study drug and had at least one post-baseline safety assessment. The study of this cohort is complete and this trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03736863.\nFindings\nBetween Dec 5, 2019, and Feb 10, 2021, 52 patients were enrolled and included in analyses. At data cutoff (June 20, 2021), median follow-up was 7·5 months (IQR 4·0–11·2). 18 (34·6%, [95% CI 22·0–49·1]) of 52 patients had a confirmed objective response. 23 (44%) of 52 patients had grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-related adverse events were increased aspartate aminotransferase (10 [19%]), increased gamma-glutamyltransferase (10 [19%]), and increased alanine aminotransferase (five [10%]). No treatment-related deaths occurred.\nInterpretation\nCamrelizumab combined with apatinib showed promising activity and manageable toxicity, and might be a potential second-line treatment option for patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

  {"id":"middletonAlcoholConsumptionOesophageal2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The contribution of alcohol to the large burden of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in east Africa remains uncertain and difficult to assess owing to complex consumption patterns of traditional and commercial drinks. We aimed to assess whether alcohol drinking, overall and at specific intake levels, contributes to ESCC risk in east Africa.\nMETHODS: We did a hospital-based case-control study in Kenya, Tanzania, and Malawi, which included comprehensive assessment of a variety of locally consumed alcohol that we used to classify drinkers as exclusively low alcohol-by-volume (ABV; <30% ABV) drinkers or drinkers of some high-ABV drinks, as well as the number of drinks consumed, average weekly ethanol intake, and the contribution of each drink type to overall ethanol consumption. Cases were patients aged 18 years and older with incident primary ESCC, confirmed histologically for the majority of cases, and a clinical diagnosis for the remainder. Controls were frequency-matched on age and sex in a 1:1 ratio with cases. The controls were recruited from the same hospitals as cases and included outpatients, inpatients, and hospital visitors who did not have cancer or any other digestive disease. Consenting participants took part in face-to-face interviews in which they were asked whether they had ever consumed alcohol (the primary exposure variable); those who had were asked follow-up questions about their consumption habits for different alcoholic drinks.\nFINDINGS: 1279 cases and 1346 controls were recruited between Aug 5, 2013, and May 24, 2020, including 430 cases and 440 controls from Kenya, 310 cases and 313 controls from Tanzania, and 539 cases and 593 controls from Malawi. 65 (4·8%) of 1344 cases were excluded. Consistent positive associations with ESCC risk were found for ever having consumed alcohol in Kenyan men and Tanzanian men, and for daily number of drinks and estimated ethanol intake in Kenya, Tanzania (both sexes) and Malawian women. Corresponding population-attributable fractions of ESCC for those reporting ever drinking alcohol (vs never drinking) were 65% (95% CI 52-78) in Kenyan men and 23% (<1-45) in Kenyan women, and 56% (95% CI 36-76) in Tanzanian men and 5% (0-42) in Tanzanian women. Increased risk and population-attributable fractions were almost entirely due to risks in high-ABV drinkers.\nINTERPRETATION: Alcohol appears to be a substantial contributor to ESCC risk in east Africa, particularly among men, and a large fraction of ESCC could be prevented by cessation or reduction of alcohol consumption. Future studies should consider independent ascertainment of alcohol intake to assess the potential of under-reporting in Malawi.\nFUNDING: US National Cancer Institute, Wereld Kanker Onderzoek Fonds, and the IARC Environment and Lifestyle Epidemiology Branch.\nTRANSLATIONS: For the Swahili and Chichewa translations of the abstract see Supplementary Materials section.","author":[{"family":"Middleton","given":"Daniel R.

  {"id":"moehlerRationale305Phase2023","abstract":"286\n\nBackground: In a phase 2 study, tislelizumab (TIS), an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, plus chemotherapy demonstrated durable antitumor activity as 1L in Chinese GC/GEJC patients (Xu et al, 2020). RATIONALE 305 (NCT03777657) was a global, double-blind, phase 3 study comparing 1L TIS plus investigator-chosen chemotherapy (TIS+ICC) vs placebo plus ICC (P+ICC) in GC/GEJC patients. Results from the interim analysis (IA) in the PD-L1+ population are presented; ITT population outcomes will be presented after final analysis. Methods: Adults with previously untreated, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic GC/GEJC, regardless of PD-L1 expression, were randomized (1:1) to receive TIS (200 mg IV Q3W) plus ICC (oxaliplatin [130 mg/m² IV Q3W] and oral capecitabine [1,000 mg/m² BID, Days 1-14 Q3W] or cisplatin [80 mg/m² IV Q3W] and 5-fluorouracil [800 mg/m²/day IV, Days 1-5 Q3W]) or P+ICC. Randomization was stratified by region, PD-L1 expression, peritoneal metastasis, and ICC. Patients with known HER2-positive status were excluded. RATIONALE 305 had dual primary endpoints of OS in the PD-L1+ and ITT analysis set; PD-L1+ was defined as PD-L1 TAP score ≥5% (VENTANA SP263 assay) assessed by blinded independent central laboratory. Secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR and DoR per RECIST 1.1, HRQoL, and safety profile. The prespecified IA was conducted after ~70% of total OS events had occurred. Results: Of 546 PD-L1+ patients enrolled from 13 counties/regions (73.8 % Asia; 26.2% Europe/ North America), 274 were randomized to receive TIS+ICC and 272 to receive P+ICC. As of 8 Oct 2021, median follow-up was 11.8 (TIS+ICC) and 11.7 mo (P+ICC). TIS+ICC showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful OS improvement vs P+ICC (HR 0.74 [95% CI: 0.59-0.94], mOS 17.2 vs 12.6 mo; 1-sided P= .0056). Compared with P+ICC, TIS+ICC also had longer PFS (mPFS 7.2 vs 5.9 mo; HR 0.67 [95% CI: 0.55-0.83]), higher ORR (50.4% vs 43.0%), and more durable response (mDoR 9.0 vs 7.1 mo). Patients treated with TIS+ICC reported better HRQoL than patients treated with P+ICC, as indicated by EORTC-QLQ-C30 global health status and physical functioning scores as well as the QLQST022 index score. No new safety signals were observed with TIS+ICC or P+ICC. While TEAEs leading to discontinuation of any treatment were higher with TIS+ICC than P+ICC (22.4% vs 12.1%), incidence rates of grade ≥3 TEAEs (64.7% vs 62.9%), serious TEAEs (42.3% vs 36.8%), and TEAEs leading to death (8.8% vs 7.7%) were comparable between both arms. Conclusions: In RATIONALE 305, TIS+ICC provided significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS vs P+ICC with well acceptable safety as 1L in PD-L1+ patients with advanced GC/GEJC. These data suggest this combination is a new 1L option for this patient population.

The disease is caused by cold reactive autoantibodies that induce hemolysis through the activation of the complement pathway. Most patients with CAD are elderly, and half may have refractory CAD that may not respond to the first-line treatment option (i.e. rituximab). Some cases are refractory to multiple lines of therapy, including chemotherapeutic agents, which might be toxic, especially for elderly patients. Daratumumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting CD 38 glycoprotein, a transmembrane protein highly expressed in lymphoid and plasma cells. Daratumumab is currently approved for treating multiple myeloma and is used mainly as a combination therapy with other agents.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Our patient is a 69-year-old female diagnosed with CAD after presenting with severe anemia and significant circulatory symptoms. Rituximab was not effective in controlling her disease, and she refused other available chemotherapeutic agents due to their side effects profile. We used daratumumab combined with erythropoietin, which led to a dramatic response measured by stabilizing her hemoglobin levels and transfusion independence.\nCONCLUSION: Our case is the third reported case of refractory CAD successfully treated with daratumumab, which suggests that daratumumab might be a potential agent for the treatment and control of refractory Cold Agglutinin Disease.","author":[{"family":"Mohamed","given":"Abdelaziz"},{"family":"Alkhatib","given":"Mohammed"},{"family":"Alshurafa","given":"Awni"},{"family":"El Omri","given":"Halima"}],"citation-key":"mohamedRefractoryColdAgglutinin2023","container-title":"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","container-title-short":"Hematology","DOI":"10.1080/16078454.2023.2252651","ISSN":"1607-8454","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",12]]},"language":"eng","page":"2252651","PMID":"37664905","source":"PubMed","title":"Refractory cold agglutinin disease successfully treated with daratumumab.

  {"id":"monigEarlyEsophagealCancer2018","abstract":"Early carcinomas of the esophagus are histologically classified as adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and microscopically subdivided into mucosal and submucosal carcinomas depending on infiltration depth. The prevalence of lymph node metastasis in mucosal carcinoma remains low. However, lymph node metastases arise frequently from tumors with submucosal infiltration, with increasing prevalence in the deeper submucosal sublayers. According to current German guidelines, endoscopic resection is the recommended treatment in mucosal adenocarcinoma without histologic risk factors (lymphatic invasion 1, vascular invasion 1, >grade 2, R1-margin). In superficial submucosal infiltration without histologic risk factors, endoscopic resection can be considered. In squamous cell carcinoma, endoscopic resection is indicated up to middle layer mucosal carcinoma. Beyond these criteria, surgical resection should be considered. The gold standard is a subtotal transthoracic esophagectomy with two-field lymphadenectomy. Total esophagectomy is performed in cervical esophageal carcinoma and transhiatal extended gastrectomy in carcinoma of the cardia. Minimally invasive procedures show good oncologic results and reduce the morbidity of radical esophagectomy. Reduced morbidity might be an argument for surgical resection in borderline cases between endoscopic and surgical resection. In early squamous cell cancer, the combination of endoscopic resection and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is a therapeutic option with promising results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Mönig","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Chevallay","given":"Mickael"},{"family":"Niclauss","given":"Nadja"},{"family":"Zilli","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Bansal","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Hoeppner","given":"Jens"}],"citation-key":"monigEarlyEsophagealCancer2018","container-title":"Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences","DOI":"10.1111/nyas.13955","ISSN":"1749-6632","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.","page":"115-123","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Early esophageal cancer: the significance of surgery, endoscopy, and chemoradiation","title-short":"Early esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/nyas.13955","volume":"1434"},

It has a global annual incidence of 1-2 per million people. It mostly affects older adults and women. The median survival duration after diagnosis does not exceed 6-8 months.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 60-year-old female patient of mixed race (Honduran) presented to the local medical service with dysphonia that had started approximately 2 months earlier, accompanied by orthopnea that had started 1 month earlier. On physical examination, a soft mass was palpated within the anterior neck region; it was approximately 4 cm in diameter, painless, and mobile on swallowing, and had irregular margins. Ultrasound and computed tomography of the neck were performed. Subsequently, fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. The histological diagnosis was anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (stage IVB). She underwent total thyroidectomy and chemotherapy. She is currently in her fifth year of remission after diagnosis and remains under oncologic surveillance.\nDISCUSSION: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma demonstrates a lethal behavior. Approximately 18% survive for more than a year after diagnosis, and 0-10% survive for 5 years.

  {"id":"nahon-esteveSmallChallengingConjunctival2021","abstract":"Although its incidence has increased over the last decades, conjunctival melanoma (CM) remains a rare but challenging periocular malignancy. While there is currently no recognized standard of care, “no-touch” surgical excision followed by adjuvant treatments is usually recommended. Despite its small size, managing CM is challenging for clinicians. The first challenge is the high risk of tumour local recurrence that occurs in about one third of the patients. The management of locally advanced CM (≥T2) or multiple recurrences may require mutilating surgeries such as orbital exenteration (OE). The second challenge is the metastatic spread of CM that occurs in about one quarter of patients, regardless of whether complete surgical excision is performed or not. This highlights the infiltrative and highly aggressive behaviour of CM. Recently, attention has been directed towards the use of eye-sparing strategies to avoid OE. Initially, wide conservative surgeries followed by customized brachytherapy or radiotherapy have appeared as viable strategies. Nowadays, new biological insights into CM have revealed similarities with cutaneous melanoma. These new findings have allowed clinicians to reconsider the management of locally advanced CM with “medical” eye-sparing treatment as well as the management of metastatic spread. The aim of this review was to summarize the current and future perspectives of treatment for CM based on recent biological findings.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Nahon-Estève","given":"Sacha"},{"family":"Bertolotto","given":"Corine"},{"family":"Picard-Gauci","given":"Alexandra"},{"family":"Gastaud","given":"Lauris"},{"family":"Baillif","given":"Stéphanie"},{"family":"Hofman","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Groulier","given":"Anaïs"},{"family":"Maschi","given":"Célia"},{"family":"Caujolle","given":"Jean-Pierre"},{"family":"Lassalle","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Martel","given":"Arnaud"}],"citation-key":"nahon-esteveSmallChallengingConjunctival2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13225691","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"22","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","page":"5691","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Small but Challenging Conjunctival Melanoma: New Insights, Paradigms and Future Perspectives","title-short":"Small but Challenging Conjunctival Melanoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/22/5691","volume":"13"},
  {"id":"nairPhaseIIRandomized2019","abstract":"6054\n\nBackground: When combined with COX-2 inhibitors, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor Erlotinib has shown a better antitumor response in preclinical studies. Since high volume hospitals in many countries usually have a longer waiting period for surgery, neoadjuvant targeted therapy may be helpful in reducing disease progression and downstaging oral squamous cell cancers. Methods: Sixty-four treatment-naïve operable oral cancer patients were randomized into a four-arm window of opportunity study consisting of treatment with erlotinib 150mg daily, celecoxib 200mg twice daily, the combination of both or observation alone (NCT02748707). Since the regular wait period for surgery at our hospital was four to five weeks, we planned a 21-day drug treatment versus observation followed by definitive surgery in the fourth week. MRI scans and biopsies were done before and after drug treatment. Post-operative adjuvant treatments were given as per the standard guidelines used for regular patients. Results: There were 10 females and 54 males with a mean and median age of 44 and 45 years respectively. Taking a 20% reduction in the maximum tumor dimension after drug treatment (assessed clinically and radiologically) as partial response, the combination arm had a 60% partial response and a 25% stable disease. Whereas, 60% in the control arm had disease progression. The ratio of the longest tumor dimension at day 21 versus day 0 (Clinical & MRI assessment) also showed a significant difference between the observation vs erlotinib arms (p < 0.001) using Mann-Whitney Test. Grade II/III rashes was the commonly observed toxicity predominantly in the combination arm. Though not powered for survival analysis, a significant difference (p = 0.048) was observed for two-year overall survival for celecoxib + control (60%) versus erlotinib + combination groups (86%) using Kaplan Meier estimator. Biomarker analysis (transcriptome sequencing and IHC) is being done on pre and post-treatment tumor specimens and the final results will be presented. Conclusion: Preoperative targeted therapy with erlotinib and celecoxib combination can arrest disease progression and downstage tumors with possible impact on survival. The identified biomarkers can further refine a future cohort for effective neoadjuvant targeted therapy in oral cancers.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells.

Here, we assessed outcomes in ZUMA-1 after 5 years of follow-up. Eligible adults received lymphodepleting chemotherapy followed by axi-cel (2 × 106 cells per kg). Investigator-assessed response, survival, safety, and pharmacokinetics were assessed in patients who had received treatment. The objective response rate in these 101 patients was 83% (58% complete response rate); with a median follow-up of 63.1 months, responses were ongoing in 31% of patients at data cutoff. Median overall survival (OS) was 25.8 months, and the estimated 5-year OS rate was 42.6%. Disease-specific survival (excluding deaths unrelated to disease progression) estimated at 5 years was 51.0%. No new serious adverse events or deaths related to axi-cel were observed after additional follow-up. Peripheral blood B cells were detectable in all evaluable patients at 3 years with polyclonal B-cell recovery in 91% of patients. Ongoing responses at 60 months were associated with early CAR T-cell expansion. In conclusion, this 5-year follow-up analysis of ZUMA-1 demonstrates sustained overall and disease-specific survival, with no new safety signals in patients with refractory LBCL.

In this study, we, therefore, aimed to describe the risk factors associated with ESCC and its precursor lesions.\nMETHODS: We performed an endoscopic examination of 44,857 individuals aged 40-69 years from five high incidence regions of China in 2017-2018. Participants were classified as 4 groups of normal control, esophagitis, low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia/esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (HGIN/ESCC) using an unconditional logistic regression determine risk factors.\nRESULTS: We identified 4890 esophagitis, 1874 LGIN and 437 HGIN/ESCC cases. Crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted odds ratios were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. Drinking well and surface water, salty diet, and positive family history of cancer were the common risk factors for esophagitis, LGIN and HGIN/ESCC.

Cox proportional hazard regression was used to determine independent mortality factors.\nRESULTS: Of 93 167 patients diagnosed with EC between 1973 and 2009, 49% had a histologic diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). There was an increase (almost double) in the proportion of patients with adenocarcinoma from the 1970s to 2000s (n = 2,350; 35% to n = 32,212; 61%, P < 0.001). Surgery was performed for localized disease in a majority of EC regardless of type (n = 46 683; 89%). Use of surgical treatment increased significantly over the study period (49% to 64%, P < 0.001). There was also an increase in overall median survival (6 months versus 10 months, P < 0.001) and 5-year survival rate (9% to 22%, P < 0.001). Median survival increased consistently for EAC and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) until the 1990s. After this period, median survival of EAC continued to increase more rapidly while SCC remained relatively stable.\nCONCLUSION: A significant survival improvement in esophageal cancer was seen from 1973 to 2009, largely because of earlier detection at a curative stage and greater utilization of treatment modalities (especially surgery).

  {"id":"noltingPersonalizedManagementPheochromocytoma2022","abstract":"Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas are characterized by a unique molecular landscape that allows their assignment to clusters based on underlying genetic alterations. With around 30% to 35% of Caucasian patients (a lower percentage in the Chinese population) showing germline mutations in susceptibility genes, pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas have the highest rate of heritability among all tumors. A further 35% to 40% of Caucasian patients (a higher percentage in the Chinese population) are affected by somatic driver mutations. Thus, around 70% of all patients with pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma can be assigned to 1 of 3 main molecular clusters with different phenotypes and clinical behavior. Krebs cycle/VHL/EPAS1-related cluster 1 tumors tend to a noradrenergic biochemical phenotype and require very close follow-up due to the risk of metastasis and recurrence. In contrast, kinase signaling-related cluster 2 tumors are characterized by an adrenergic phenotype and episodic symptoms, with generally a less aggressive course. The clinical correlates of patients with Wnt signaling-related cluster 3 tumors are currently poorly described, but aggressive behavior seems likely. In this review, we explore and explain why cluster-specific (personalized) management of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma is essential to ascertain clinical behavior and prognosis, guide individual diagnostic procedures (biochemical interpretation, choice of the most sensitive imaging modalities), and provide personalized management and follow-up. Although cluster-specific therapy of inoperable/metastatic disease has not yet entered routine clinical practice, we suggest that informed personalized genetic-driven treatment should be implemented as a logical next step. This review amalgamates published guidelines and expert views within each cluster for a coherent individualized patient management plan.","author":[{"family":"Nölting","given":"Svenja"},{"family":"Bechmann","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Taieb","given":"David"},{"family":"Beuschlein","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Fassnacht","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Kroiss","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Eisenhofer","given":"Graeme"},{"family":"Grossman","given":"Ashley"},{"family":"Pacak","given":"Karel"}],"citation-key":"noltingPersonalizedManagementPheochromocytoma2022","container-title":"Endocrine Reviews","container-title-short":"Endocr Rev","DOI":"10.1210/endrev/bnab019","ISSN":"1945-7189","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,9]]},"language":"eng","page":"199-239","PMCID":"PMC8905338","PMID":"34147030","source":"PubMed","title":"Personalized Management of Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma","type":"article-journal","volume":"43"},

In case of adequate resection and favorable histological outcome, long-term prognosis of the patient is excellent. The basic principle for endoscopic treatment of early adenocarcinoma is based on the fact that the risk of lymph node metastasis gradually increases with the depth of invasion. Inspection and evaluation of all mucosal and submucosal lesions need to be done carefully before endoscopic resection. Endoscopic resection of mucosal (T1m1-3) and superficial submucosal (T1sm1) adenocarcinoma can be curative as well as for superficial mucosal (T1m1-m2) squamous cell carcinoma. In Paris type I lesions in Barrett’s esophagus and for early squamous cell carcinoma endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is the preferred option. The risk of severe adverse events associated with endoscopic resection are low. Most adverse events are managed endoscopically and can be treated conservatively. Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation is the most widely used ablation technique for Barrett’s epithelium and highly effective to achieve full remission of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia. The role of radiofrequency ablation in the treatment armamentarium in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus has still to be determined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Noordzij","given":"Irma C."},{"family":"Curvers","given":"Wouter L."},{"family":"Schoon","given":"Erik J."}],"citation-key":"noordzijEndoscopicResectionEarly2019","container-title":"Journal of Thoracic Disease","container-title-short":"J Thorac Dis","DOI":"10.21037/jtd.2019.03.19","ISSN":"2072-1439","issue":"Suppl 5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"page":"S713-S722","PMCID":"PMC6503291","PMID":"31080649","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Endoscopic resection for early esophageal carcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6503291/","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"nooriPredictiveValuePDL12022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Programmed death-ligand-1 (PD-L1) molecule is a well-known predictive biomarker for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in several cancers. Present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at investigating the role of PD-L1 in predicting the effectiveness of programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients suffering from esophageal cancer.\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases as of March 25, 2022, for retrieving the potential relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The pooled hazard ratios (HR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated for the outcomes of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The primary objective was to investigate the association between PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors vs. control agents and treatment efficacy in terms of OS in patients with esophageal tumor expressing different values of PD-L1 based on combined-positive score (CPS) and tumor proportion score (TPS). The secondary outcome was the pooled risk of PFS.\nRESULTS: Eleven studies with a total of 5,418 participants were included. While there was no difference in the OS of CPS<1 patients in the intervention and the control group, patients bearing esophageal tumors with a CPS≥1 (HR 0.65, 0.56-0.74) treated by ICIs showed a significant improvement in OS relative to the control agents. Accordingly, patients with CPS<5 (HR 0.75, 0.58-0.98), CPS≥5 (HR 0.64, 0.53-0.77), CPS<10 (HR 0.86, 0.76-0.98), and CPS≥10 (HR 0.65, 0.56-0.75) had improved OS; however, a significant longer OS was observed in cases who expressed higher values of CPS=10 (p=0.018). In terms of TPS, a significant greater benefit in prolonging the OS came from TPS≥1% PD-L1 expressing tumors in comparison to TPS<1% tumors, suggesting this cut-off as another predictor of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors efficacy. Notably, in the subgroup analysis when the cut-off value of CPS=10 or TPS=1% was selected, Nivolumab was the best ICI that improved the survival of PD-L1 positive patients. In patients with negative PD-L1 expression, Toripalimib is the only ICI which could prolong the OS of patients with the cut-off value of CPS=10.\nCONCLUSION: Among patients suffering from esophageal cancer, PD-L1 CPS=10 and TPS=1% expression thresholds seem to be predictive of a lower rate of mortality when PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are administrated; however, further large-scale trials are required for confirming the findings of the present study.","author":[{"family":"Noori","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Yousefi","given":"Amir-Mohammad"},{"family":"Zali","given":"Mohammad Reza"},{"family":"Bashash","given":"Davood"}],"citation-key":"nooriPredictiveValuePDL12022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.1021859","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"1021859","PMCID":"PMC9798008","PMID":"36591463","source":"PubMed","title":"Predictive value of PD-L1 expression in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for esophageal cancer treatment: A systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Predictive value of PD-L1 expression in response to immune checkpoint inhibitors for esophageal cancer treatment","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

The standard treatment for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is surgery or chemoradiation. However, induction chemotherapy followed by (chemo) radiotherapy may be used in some circumstances. Although many clinical trials of induction chemotherapy have been conducted, a rationale other than to preserve the larynx is still controversial. Selection of this modality should therefore be made with care. The current standard regimen for induction chemotherapy is docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-FU, but concerns remain about toxicity, cost and the duration of treatment. Regarding treatment after induction chemotherapy, it is also unclear whether radiation alone or chemoradiation is the better option. Furthermore, there is no answer as to what drugs should be used in combination with radiation therapy after induction chemotherapy. Several new induction chemotherapy treatment developments are currently underway, and future developments are expected. This review article summarizes the current position of induction chemotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, based on the evidence produced to date, and discusses the future prospects for this treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Okano","given":"Susumu"},{"family":"Homma","given":"Akihiro"},{"family":"Kiyota","given":"Naomi"},{"family":"Tahara","given":"Makoto"},{"family":"Hanai","given":"Nobuhiro"},{"family":"Asakage","given":"Takahiro"},{"family":"Matsuura","given":"Kazuto"},{"family":"Ogawa","given":"Takenori"},{"family":"Saito","given":"Yuki"},{"family":"Sano","given":"Daisuke"},{"family":"Kodaira","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Motegi","given":"Atsushi"},{"family":"Yasuda","given":"Koichi"},{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Shunji"},{"family":"Tanaka","given":"Kaoru"},{"family":"Onoe","given":"Takuma"},{"family":"Yokota","given":"Tomoya"},{"family":"Imamura","given":"Yoshinori"},{"family":"Ariizumi","given":"Yosuke"},{"family":"Akimoto","given":"Tetsuo"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"Ryuichi"}],"citation-key":"okanoInductionChemotherapyLocally2021","container-title":"Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology","DOI":"10.1093/jjco/hyaa220","ISSN":"1465-3621","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2,1]]},"page":"173-179","source":"Silverchair","title":"Induction chemotherapy in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jjco/hyaa220","volume":"51"},

  {"id":"onoEndoscopicMucosalResection2001","abstract":"BACKGROUND: In Japan, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is accepted as a treatment option for cases of early gastric cancer (EGC) where the probability of lymph node metastasis is low. The results of EMR for EGC at the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, over a 11 year period are presented.\nMETHODS: EMR was applied to patients with early cancers up to 30 mm in diameter that were of a well or moderately histologically differentiated type, and were superficially elevated and/or depressed (types I, IIa, and IIc) but without ulceration or definite signs of submucosal invasion. The resected specimens were carefully examined by serial sections at 2 mm intervals, and if histopathology revealed submucosal invasion and/or vessel involvement or if the resection margin was not clear, surgery was recommended.\nRESULTS: Four hundred and seventy nine cancers in 445 patients were treated by EMR from 1987 to 1998 but submucosal invasion was found on subsequent pathological examination in 74 tumours. Sixty nine percent of intramucosal cancers (278/405) were resected with a clear margin. Of 127 cancers without \"complete resection\", 14 underwent an additional operation and nine were treated endoscopically; the remainder had intensive follow up. Local recurrence in the stomach occurred in 17 lesions followed conservatively, in one lesion treated endoscopically, and in five lesions with complete resection. All tumours were diagnosed by follow up endoscopy and subsequently treated by surgery. There were no gastric cancer related deaths during a median follow up period of 38 months (3-120 months). Bleeding and perforation (5%) were two major complications of EMR but there were no treatment related deaths.\nCONCLUSION: In our experience, EMR allows us to perform less invasive treatment without sacrificing the possibility of cure.","author":[{"family":"Ono","given":"H."},{"family":"Kondo","given":"H."},{"family":"Gotoda","given":"T."},{"family":"Shirao","given":"K."},{"family":"Yamaguchi","given":"H."},{"family":"Saito","given":"D."},{"family":"Hosokawa","given":"K."},{"family":"Shimoda","given":"T."},{"family":"Yoshida","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"onoEndoscopicMucosalResection2001","container-title":"Gut","container-title-short":"Gut","DOI":"10.1136/gut.48.2.225","ISSN":"0017-5749","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",2]]},"language":"eng","page":"225-229","PMCID":"PMC1728193","PMID":"11156645","source":"PubMed","title":"Endoscopic mucosal resection for treatment of early gastric cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"48"},

  {"id":"ostermanImprovingCancerData2020","abstract":"PURPOSE\nBecause of expanding interoperability requirements, structured patient data are increasingly available in electronic health records. Many oncology data elements (eg, staging, biomarkers, documentation of adverse events and cancer outcomes) remain challenging. The Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) project is a consensus data standard created to facilitate transmission of data of patients with cancer.\n\nMETHODS\nIn 2018, mCODE was developed through a work group convened by ASCO, including oncologists, informaticians, researchers, and experts in terminologies and standards. The mCODE specification is organized by 6 high-level domains: patient, laboratory/vital, disease, genomics, treatment, and outcome. In total, 23 mCODE profiles are composed of 90 data elements.\n\nRESULTS\nA conceptual model was published for public comment in January 2019 and, after additional refinement, the first public version of the mCODE (version 0.9.1) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) implementation guide (IG) was presented at the ASCO Annual Meeting in June 2019. The specification was approved for balloting by Health Level 7 International (HL7) in August 2019. mCODE passed the HL7 ballot in September 2019 with 86.5% approval. The mCODE IG authors worked with HL7 reviewers to resolve all negative comments, leading to a modest expansion in the number of data elements and tighter alignment with FHIR and other HL7 conventions. The mCODE version 1.0 FHIR IG Standard for Trial Use was formally published on March 18, 2020.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe mCODE project has the potential to offer tremendous benefits to cancer care delivery and research by creating an infrastructure to better share patient data. mCODE is available free from www.mCODEinitiative.org. Pilot implementations are underway, and a robust community of stakeholders has been assembled across the oncology ecosystem.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Osterman","given":"Travis J."},{"family":"Terry","given":"May"},{"family":"Miller","given":"Robert S."}],"citation-key":"ostermanImprovingCancerData2020","container-title":"JCO Clinical Cancer Informatics","container-title-short":"JCO Clin Cancer Inform","DOI":"10.1200/CCI.20.00059","ISSN":"2473-4276","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11,2]]},"page":"CCI.20.00059","PMCID":"PMC7713551","PMID":"33136433","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Improving Cancer Data Interoperability: The Promise of the Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) Initiative","title-short":"Improving Cancer Data Interoperability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7713551/","volume":"4"},
  {"id":"othmanEndoscopicMucosalResection2011","abstract":"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) has become the standard of care for removal of large flat and sessile neoplastic lesions of the GI tract. Recently, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was introduced in Japan as an alternative technique, which allows en bloc resection of large lesions. The applications of EMR and ESD are expanding and many Western endoscopists are adopting these techniques. Paris classification and Kudo pit pattern classification allows prediction of the depth of invasion of early neoplastic lesions and thus, avoids resection of lesions invading the deep submucosa which have higher rates of lymphatic spread. ESD of early stomach cancer is the standard of care in Japan. Recent published reports from Western countries showed comparable results for ESD of early gastric cancers to those done in Japan. Recently, EMR combined with ablation has been used frequently in Western countries for treatment of high-grade dysplasia in early adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Although ESD of early neoplastic lesions of the esophagus is technically difficult, few promising reports were published proving the feasibility of this technique in the West. ESD has been shown to achieve higher en bloc resection and lower rates of tumour recurrence in removal of lateral spreading colonic polyps. A hybrid technique of circumferential submucosal incision followed by en bloc EMR has been used for removal of large colonic lesions in some Western endoscopy centres. In Western countries, training for ESD is challenging given the lack of training in the relatively easier early gastric cancer lesions. Animal model training combined with observing experts in ESD could be an alternative for Western endoscopists. Inspite of obstacles, ESD applications are continuing to grow in Western countries.","author":[{"family":"Othman","given":"Mohamed O."},{"family":"Wallace","given":"Michael B."}],"citation-key":"othmanEndoscopicMucosalResection2011","container-title":"Clinics and Research in Hepatology and Gastroenterology","container-title-short":"Clin Res Hepatol Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.1016/j.clinre.2011.02.006","ISSN":"2210-741X","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"288-294","PMID":"21458402","source":"PubMed","title":"Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in 2011, a Western perspective","type":"article-journal","volume":"35"},
  {"id":"paezGrayLiteratureImportant2017","abstract":"Systematic reviews aide the analysis and dissemination of evidence, using rigorous and transparent methods to generate empirically attained answers to focused research questions. Identifying all evidence relevant to the research questions is an essential component, and challenge, of systematic reviews. Gray literature, or evidence not published in commercial publications, can make important contributions to a systematic review. Gray literature can include academic papers, including theses and dissertations, research and committee reports, government reports, conference papers, and ongoing research, among others. It may provide data not found within commercially published literature, providing an important forum for disseminating studies with null or negative results that might not otherwise be disseminated. Gray literature may thusly reduce publication bias, increase reviews’ comprehensiveness and timeliness, and foster a balanced picture of available evidence. Gray literature's diverse formats and audiences can present a significant challenge in a systematic search for evidence. However, the benefits of including gray literature may far outweigh the cost in time and resource needed to search for it, and it is important for it to be included in a systematic review or review of evidence. A carefully thought out gray literature search strategy may be an invaluable component of a systematic review. This narrative review provides guidance about the benefits of including gray literature in a systematic review, and sources for searching through gray literature.

The aim of this retrospective study was to describe the incidence of CNS relapse among 100 consecutive patients with PMLBCL who were treated with R-CHOP ± RT in comparison to patients treated with CHOP ± RT (n = 45) in 11 hospitals in Greece. Two patients experienced a CNS relapse, representing an overall frequency of 2.0% in R-CHOP treated patients and a 2-year actuarial incidence of 2.3%. Both patients had isolated CNS relapses. The incidence of CNS relapse after CHOP without Rituximab was 2/45 (4.4%) for a 2-year actuarial incidence of 7.5% (p = 0.29). Again, both patients had isolated CNS relapses. Parenchymal-only localizations accounted for 3/4 cases. Risk factors for CNS involvement could include leukocytosis, poor performance status and higher age-adjusted International Prognostic Index, although their impact was weakened by competing risk survival analysis. Both patients relapsing after R-CHOP required CNS radiotherapy to achieve a complete remission and be forwarded to high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation: They are both alive and disease-free 18 and 23 months after CNS relapse. Both cases relapsing after CHOP without Rituximab were salvaged by CNS radiotherapy (one also received intrathecal chemotherapy) entering long-term remissions. In conclusion, CNS relapses are rare in PMLBCL tending to be isolated in the CNS, probably reflecting the persistence of latent CNS disease than dissemination of resistant disease. The impact of Rituximab in reducing CNS relapses remains unknown. Established risk factors for CNS involvement in aggressive lymphomas may not be helpful in assessing the risk of CNS recurrence in this disease. Routine CNS prophylaxis is not probably required in PMLBCL.","author":[{"family":"Papageorgiou","given":"Sotirios G."},{"family":"Diamantopoulos","given":"Panayiotis"},{"family":"Levidou","given":"Georgia"},{"family":"Angelopoulou","given":"Maria K."},{"family":"Economopoulou","given":"Panagiota"},{"family":"Efthimiou","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Constantinou","given":"Nikos"},{"family":"Katsigiannis","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Korkolopoulou","given":"Penelope"},{"family":"Pappa","given":"Vassiliki"},{"family":"Economopoulou","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Georgiou","given":"George"},{"family":"Dimou","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Tsirigotis","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Kyrtsonis","given":"Marie-Christine"},{"family":"Kotsianidis","given":"Ioannis"},{"family":"Kalpadakis","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Dimopoulos","given":"Meletios-Athanassios"},{"family":"Beris","given":"Photis"},{"family":"Meletis","given":"John"},{"family":"Pangalis","given":"Gerassimos A."},{"family":"Dervenoulas","given":"John"},{"family":"Panayiotidis","given":"Panayiotis"},{"family":"Vassilakopoulos","given":"Theodoros P."}],"citation-key":"papageorgiouIsolatedCentralNervous2013","container-title":"Hematological Oncology","container-title-short":"Hematol Oncol","DOI":"10.1002/hon.2012","ISSN":"1099-1069","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3]]},"language":"eng","page":"10-17","PMID":"22610484","source":"PubMed","title":"Isolated central nervous system relapses in primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma after CHOP-like chemotherapy with or without Rituximab","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1002/hon.2012","volume":"31"},

The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between shame and low functional literacy in the health care setting. It hypothesized that many patients with low literacy may not admit they have difficulty reading because of shame. Patients who presented for acute care at a large, public hospital in Atlanta, Georgia were interviewed. A total of 202 predominately indigent African-American patients completed a demographic survey, the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (TOFHLA) and answered questions about difficulty reading and shame. Of the 202 patients interviewed, 42.6% had inadequate or marginal functional health literacy. Patients with low literacy were more likely to be male (P < 0.05), have less than a high school education (P < 0.01) and be over the age of 60 (P < 0.01). Of those patients with low literacy, 67.4% admitted having trouble reading and understanding what they read. Almost 40% (n = 23) of patients with low functional literacy who acknowledged they have trouble reading admitted shame. Of the 58 patients who had low functional health literacy and admitted having trouble reading, 67.2% had never told their spouses, and 53.4% had never told their children of their difficulties reading. Nineteen percent of patients had never disclosed their difficulty reading to anyone. Many patients with reading problems are ashamed and hide their inability to read.

  {"id":"passPhotodynamicTherapyOncology1993","abstract":"In photodynamic therapy (PDT), a sensitizer, light, and oxygen are used to cause photochemically induced cell death. The mechanism of cytotoxicity involves generation of singlet oxygen and other free radicals when the light-excited sensitizer loses or accepts an electron. Although selective retention of sensitizer by malignant tissue is seen in vivo, the mechanisms for this sensitizer targeting remain unclear. The first-generation sensitizers are porphyrin based and vary in lipophilicity and hydrophilicity. Targeting of the vasculature seems to be a prominent feature of the cytotoxic effect of these sensitizers in vivo, with resulting necrosis. Treatment depth varies with the wavelength of light that activates the sensitizer used, and the second-generation sensitizers are activated at longer wavelengths, allowing for a 30% increase in treatment depths. The selectivity of targeting can be increased when the sensitizer is delivered with the use of liposomes or monoclonal antibodies specific for tumor antigens. Studies have demonstrated direct effects of PDT on immune effector cells, specifically those with lineage from macrophages or other monocytes. Clinically, this therapy has been chiefly used for palliation of endobronchial and esophageal obstruction, as well as for treatment of bladder carcinomas, skin malignancies, and brain tumors. The future of PDT rests in defining its use either as an intraoperative adjuvant to marginal surgical procedures or as a primary treatment for superficial malignancies. Phase III trials in esophageal cancer and lung cancer are in progress and will help in evaluation of whether Photofrin II, the most widely used sensitizer, can be added to the oncologic armamentarium, pending approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

A metronomic combination of weekly methotrexate and celecoxib seems equally effective to single agent cisplatin in the palliative setting, but needs phase III testing. The same metronomic combination seems inferior to paclitaxel-cetuximab. Triple drug metronomic chemotherapy (methotrexate, celecoxib, and erlotinib) is still under development with promising data from pilot studies. Metronomic chemotherapy also seems beneficial in the curative setting but results of confirmatory studies are eagerly awaited. The low rate of adverse events and low cost make this regimen an attractive alternative. Both in vivo and in-vitro data suggests that numerous drugs like anthelmintics, DMARDs, antimalarials can be repurposed for Head and Neck Cancers.

  {"id":"patrignaniOptimizingAspirinDose2024","abstract":"Background: Low-dose aspirin's mechanism of action for preventing colorectal cancer (CRC) is still debated, and the optimal dose remains uncertain. We aimed to optimize the aspirin dose for cancer prevention in CRC patients through deep phenotyping using innovative biomarkers for aspirin's action. Methods: We conducted a Phase II, open-label clinical trial in 34 CRC patients of both sexes randomized to receive enteric-coated aspirin 100 mg/d, 100 mg/BID, or 300 mg/d for 3 ± 1 weeks. Biomarkers were evaluated in blood, urine, and colorectal biopsies at baseline and after dosing with aspirin. Novel biomarkers of aspirin action were assessed in platelets and colorectal tissues using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify the extent of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 acetylation at Serine 529 and Serine 516, respectively. Results: All aspirin doses caused comparable % acetylation of platelet COX-1 at Serine 529 associated with similar profound inhibition of platelet-dependent thromboxane (TX)A2 generation ex vivo (serum TXB2) and in vivo (urinary TXM). TXB2 was significantly reduced in CRC tissue by aspirin 300 mg/d and 100 mg/BID, associated with comparable % acetylation of COX-1. Differently, 100 mg/day showed a lower % acetylation of COX-1 in CRC tissue and no significant reduction of TXB2. Prostaglandin (PG)E2 biosynthesis in colorectal tumors and in vivo (urinary PGEM) remained unaffected by any dose of aspirin associated with the variable and low extent of COX-2 acetylation at Serine 516 in tumor tissue. Increased expression of tumor-promoting genes like VIM (vimentin) and TWIST1 (Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1) vs. baseline was detected with 100 mg/d of aspirin but not with the other two higher doses. Conclusion: In CRC patients, aspirin 300 mg/d or 100 mg/BID had comparable antiplatelet effects to aspirin 100 mg/d, indicating similar inhibition of the platelet's contribution to cancer. However, aspirin 300 mg/d and 100 mg/BID can have additional anticancer effects by inhibiting cancerous tissue's TXA2 biosynthesis associated with a restraining impact on tumor-promoting gene expression.

Correlates of OS were explored using univariate analysis and multivariable analysis (MVA).\nRESULTS: In total, 1288 patients were analyzed. The mean patient age was 70.2 years, 59.7% of patients were women, and 47.6% received neck RT. The median OS was 2.27 months, and 11% of patients remained alive at 1 year. A positive RT dose-survival correlation was observed for the entire study cohort, for those who received systemic therapy, and for those with stage IVA/IVB and IVC disease. On MVA, older age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.317; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.137-1.526), ≥ 1 comorbidity (HR, 1.587; 95% CI, 1.379-1.827), distant metastasis (HR, 1.385; 95% CI, 1.216-1.578), receipt of systemic therapy (HR, 0.637; 95% CI, 0.547-0.742), and receipt of RT compared with no RT (<45 grays [Gy]:HR, 0.843; 95% CI, 0.718-0.988; 45-59.9 Gy: HR, 0.596; 95% CI, 0.479-0.743; 60-75 Gy: HR, 0.419; 95% CI, 0.339-0.517) correlated with OS. The RT dose-survival correlation for patients who received higher (60-75 Gy) versus lower (45-59.9 Gy) therapeutic doses was confirmed by propensity-score matching.\nCONCLUSIONS: Survival was poor in this cohort of patients with unresected ATC, and more effective therapies are needed. However, the association of RT dose with OS highlights the importance of identifying patients with unresected ATC who may still yet benefit from multimodal locoregional treatment that incorporates higher dose RT.

The implementation of targeted therapy against HER2 as part of the standard of care treatment in metastatic disease has improved the prognosis of this subset of patients. However, gastric cancer still has high mortality rates and urgently requires new treatment strategies. The combination of immunotherapy with HER2-targeted therapies has shown synergistic effects in preclinical models, this being the rationale behind exploring this combination in clinical trials in locally advanced and metastatic settings. Additionally, the irruption of antibody–drug conjugates and other novel HER2-targeted agents has led to the development of numerous clinical trials showing promising results. This review presents the molecular mechanisms supporting the use of HER2-targeted drugs in combination with immunotherapy and provides an overview of the therapeutic scenario of HER2-positive disease.

Since the first promising data on second-line treatment with checkpoint inhibitors in esophageal cancer patients were published, immunotherapy was surmised to change the face of modern cancer treatment. Recently, several studies have found this to be true, as the checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have achieved revolutionary response rates in advanced as well as resectable settings in esophageal cancer patients. Although the current results of large clinical trials promise high efficacy with tolerable toxicity, desirable survival rates, and sustained quality of life, some concerns remain. This review aims to summarize the novel clinical data on immunotherapeutic agents for esophageal cancer and provide a critical view of potential restrictions for the implementation of these therapies for unselected patient populations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Puhr","given":"Hannah Christina"},{"family":"Preusser","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Ilhan-Mutlu","given":"Aysegül"}],"citation-key":"puhrImmunotherapyEsophagealCancers2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13184632","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"18","page":"4632","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Immunotherapy for Esophageal Cancers: What Is Practice Changing in 2021?","title-short":"Immunotherapy for Esophageal Cancers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/18/4632","volume":"13"},

Eighty-one patients diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL, n = 68), primary mediastinal DLBCL (n = 6) and follicular lymphoma Grade 3b (n = 7), with an age-adjusted International Prognostic Index >1, were eligible for analysis. Median age was 60 years (range: 21–77). Sixty-five patients (80·2%) achieved complete response. After a median follow-up time of 64 months, 10-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) were 47·8% and 63·6%, respectively. None of the studied clinical and biological characteristics were associated with poorer outcome. Interestingly, patients with BCL6 rearrangement achieved a 10-year OS of 100%, while patients with BCL2 rearrangement exhibited a poorer outcome compared to activated B-cell tumours and germinal centre B-cell without BCL2 rearranged tumours. Results achieved with DA-EPOCH-R showed a good long-term outcome and a tolerable toxicity profile in high-risk large B cell lymphoma patients. Outcome was not affected by tumour cell proliferation or by cell of origin, highlighting the requirement of new biological markers for patient subclassification of high-risk DLBCL patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Purroy","given":"Noelia"},{"family":"Bergua","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Gallur","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Prieto","given":"Julio"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Luis A."},{"family":"Sancho","given":"Juan M."},{"family":"García-Marco","given":"Jose A."},{"family":"Castellví","given":"Josep"},{"family":"Montes-Moreno","given":"Santiago"},{"family":"Batlle","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Villambrosia","given":"Sonia Gonzalez","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Carnicero","given":"Fernando"},{"family":"Ferrando-Lamana","given":"Lucía"},{"family":"Piris","given":"Miguel A"},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Andrés"}],"citation-key":"purroyLongtermFollowupDoseadjusted2015","container-title":"British Journal of Haematology","DOI":"10.1111/bjh.13273","ISSN":"1365-2141","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"188-198","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Long-term follow-up of dose-adjusted EPOCH plus rituximab (DA-EPOCH-R) in untreated patients with poor prognosis large B-cell lymphoma.

  {"id":"radfordLearningTransferableVisual2021","abstract":"State-of-the-art computer vision systems are trained to predict a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Radford","given":"Alec"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jong Wook"},{"family":"Hallacy","given":"Chris"},{"family":"Ramesh","given":"Aditya"},{"family":"Goh","given":"Gabriel"},{"family":"Agarwal","given":"Sandhini"},{"family":"Sastry","given":"Girish"},{"family":"Askell","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Mishkin","given":"Pamela"},{"family":"Clark","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Krueger","given":"Gretchen"},{"family":"Sutskever","given":"Ilya"}],"citation-key":"radfordLearningTransferableVisual2021","container-title":"Proceedings of the 38th International Conference on Machine Learning","event-title":"International Conference on Machine Learning","ISSN":"2640-3498","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"8748-8763","publisher":"PMLR","source":"proceedings.mlr.press","title":"Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/radford21a.html"},

In the last years, the high-throughput genomics has been able to identify pathways/molecular targets involved in survival and tumor progression. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy individually have many limitations. Regarding the first one, although it greatly reduces the size of the cancer, clinical responses are generally transient and often lead to cancer relapse after initial treatment. For the second one, although it induces longer-lasting responses in cancer patients than targeted therapy, its response rate is lower. The individual limitations of these two different types of therapies can be overcome by combining them. Here, we discuss MAPK pathway inhibitors, i.e., BRAF and MEK inhibitors, combined with checkpoint inhibitors targeting PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4. Several mutations make tumors resistant to treatments. Therefore, more studies are needed to investigate the patient's individual tumor mutation burden in order to overcome the problem of resistance to therapy and to develop new combination therapies.","author":[{"family":"Ragusa","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Silvia Martina"},{"family":"Elia","given":"Giusy"},{"family":"Paparo","given":"Sabrina Rosaria"},{"family":"Balestri","given":"Eugenia"},{"family":"Botrini","given":"Chiara"},{"family":"Patrizio","given":"Armando"},{"family":"Mazzi","given":"Valeria"},{"family":"Guglielmi","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Foddis","given":"Rudy"},{"family":"Spinelli","given":"Claudio"},{"family":"Ulisse","given":"Salvatore"},{"family":"Antonelli","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Fallahi","given":"Poupak"}],"citation-key":"ragusaCombinationStrategiesInvolving2022","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"Int J Mol Sci","DOI":"10.3390/ijms23105731","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,20]]},"language":"eng","page":"5731","PMCID":"PMC9144613","PMID":"35628540","source":"PubMed","title":"Combination Strategies Involving Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors and Tyrosine Kinase or BRAF Inhibitors in Aggressive Thyroid Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"23"},

However, only a minority of patients respond, hence the search for predictive biomarkers. Potential predictive biomarkers for immune checkpoint inhibitors discussed in this chapter include (1) Immune checkpoint ligand expression e.g., PD-L1, (2) biomarkers of a T-cell inflamed tumour microenvironment (TME) such as gene expression profiles of activated T cells, (3) biomarkers of tumour neoepitope burden such as tumour mutation burden (TMB) and (4) multidimensional quantitative techniques. At present only PD-L1 expression has been shown to have clinical utility in head and neck cancer. It enriches for populations more likely to respond, but the false positive predictive value remains high. In the pivotal Keynote−048 trial that established a role for pembrolizumab (anti-PD1) monotherapy and pembrolizumab + chemotherapy as treatment options in first-line R/M HNSCC, primary endpoints included overall survival in defined subgroups based on PD-L1 expression. In this trial the combined positive score (CPS) was used which takes into account PD-L1 expression in tumour and immune cells. Based on this trial regulatory approvals for first-line pembrolizumab in R/M HNSCC require assessment of PD-L1 expression using the CPS. Finally we discuss emerging evidence that locoregionally advanced HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers that have high expression of CD103 positive CD8 T cells have an excellent prognosis and features that suggest increased probability of responding to anti-PD1/PD-L1, raising the possibility of incorporating these immune therapies as part of a de-escalation trial strategy.","author":[{"family":"Rischin","given":"Danny"}],"citation-key":"rischinBiomarkersImmuneModulatory2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_6","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

Immune checkpoint blockade agents have only recently been posited as a trigger for RRP. Here, we present three cases of immunotherapy-induced RRP.\n\nCase Presentation\nOur first patient was diagnosed with primary lung adenocarcinoma, and 4.5 years after completing radiation therapy developed symptomatic RRP immediately following a second dose of nivolumab-containing immunotherapy regimen. Our second patient was diagnosed with primary bladder cancer metastatic to the mediastinum, which was treated twice with radiation therapy. He developed RRP in the days following his second course of ipilimumab-pembrolizumab which was months after his second course of radiation that he received. Our final patient was diagnosed with metastatic small cell lung cancer and received local consolidative radiation therapy in addition to whole-brain radiation. He developed RRP on the 11th day after concluding his 4th cycle of nivolumab-ipilimumab, approximately 7 months after having had completed chest radiation therapy.\n\nConclusions\nImmunotherapy-induced RRP is a rare diagnosis which can present more focally than traditional immunotherapy pneumonitis and which must be clinically differentiated from other local processes such as pneumonia. Further research should explore the mechanisms underlying these radiation recall reactions as many patients receive radiation and immunotherapy during the course of their cancer treatment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Riviere","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Sumner","given":"Whitney"},{"family":"Cornell","given":"Mariel"},{"family":"Sandhu","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Murphy","given":"James D."},{"family":"Hattangadi-Gluth","given":"Jona"},{"family":"Bruggeman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sangwoo S."},{"family":"Randall","given":"J.

Responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite instability-high tumours of other locations have shown promising results, and with the extended approval of the PD-1 receptor inhibitor pembrolizumab by the Food and Drug Administration, also anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) requires analysis for microsatellite instability (MSI) status.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic research for relevant literature was conducted in different databases. Prevalence, detection methods, and the potential prognostic/predictive value of MSI in view of the available targeted therapies were of special focus.\nRESULTS: Selected citations revealed the prevalence of MSI in 7.4%, with mutations in the MSH2 gene (33%) being the most frequent, followed by MSH6 (25%) and MLH1 (16.7%) occurring in the following combinations: MLH1-MSH2 (8.3%), MSH2-MSH6 (8.3%), and MLH3-MSH5 (8.3%). No mutations in the PMS2 gene were reported. Sixty-six co-mutations in 9 cases were found, with TP53 (88.9%), NF1 (44.4 %), ATM (33.3%), and RB1 (33.3%) being the most frequent. No RAS mutations were noted. Survival ranged between 2.8 and 48 months, and patient age varied between 49 and 84 years. There are insufficient and heterogenous data concerning the predictive or prognostic value of mismatch repair-deficient/microsatellite instability status.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tumour molecular profiling is fundamental in ATC for predictive, prognostic, as well as therapeutic reasons, and analysis of MSI status is strongly suggested because a small subgroup show the MSI signature and might profit from recently approved targeted therapies.","author":[{"family":"Rocha","given":"Maria Linda"},{"family":"Schmid","given":"Kurt Werner"},{"family":"Czapiewski","given":"Piotr"}],"citation-key":"rochaPrevalenceDNAMicrosatellite2021","container-title":"Contemporary Oncology (Poznan, Poland)","container-title-short":"Contemp Oncol (Pozn)","DOI":"10.5114/wo.2021.110052","ISSN":"1428-2526","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"213-223","PMCID":"PMC8547184","PMID":"34729042","source":"PubMed","title":"The prevalence of DNA microsatellite instability in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma - systematic review and discussion of current therapeutic options","type":"article-journal","volume":"25"},
  {"id":"romeiClinicalPathologicalGenetic2018","abstract":"Anaplastic (ATC) and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) are very aggressive cancers whose histological diagnosis is not always straightforward. Clinical, pathological and genetic features may be useful to improve the identification of these rare histotypes. In the present study the clinical, pathological and genetic features of two groups of ATC (n=21) and PDTC (n=21) patients were analyzed. Clinical data were retrieved from a computerized database. The oncogenic profiles were studied using the Sanger sequencing method of a selected series of oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes known to be altered in these tumors. The presence of macrophages in both series of tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Patients with ATC were older and affected by a more advanced disease at diagnosis than those with PDTC. The median survival was significantly shorter in ATC compared with PDTC patients (P=0.0014). ATC showed a higher prevalence of TP53 and TERT mutations (10/21, 47.6% and 9/21, 42.8%, respectively) while TERT and BRAF mutations were the most prevalent in the PDTC group (7/21, 33.3% and 4/23, 19% respectively). Genetic heterogeneity (i.e., >2 mutations) was more frequent in ATC (10/21, 28.6%) compared with in PDTC (3/21, 4.7%) (P=0.03). Macrophages were more frequently present in ATC, particularly in those cases with TP53 mutations. In conclusion, these data indicate that ATC and PDTC may be characterized by different clinical, pathological and genetic profiles. In particular ATC, but not PDTC, were positive for TP53 and PTEN alterations. Complex mutations were also found in ATC but not in PDTC. Moreover, genetic heterogeneity was more frequent in ATC than PDTC. Finally, TP53 mutation and the accumulation of several mutations correlated with a shorter survival time.","author":[{"family":"Romei","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Tacito","given":"Alessia"},{"family":"Molinaro","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Piaggi","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Cappagli","given":"Virginia"},{"family":"Pieruzzi","given":"Letizia"},{"family":"Matrone","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Viola","given":"David"},{"family":"Agate","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Torregrossa","given":"Liborio"},{"family":"Ugolini","given":"Clara"},{"family":"Basolo","given":"Fulvio"},{"family":"De Napoli","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Curcio","given":"Michele"},{"family":"Ciampi","given":"Raffaele"},{"family":"Materazzi","given":"Gabriele"},{"family":"Vitti","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Elisei","given":"Rossella"}],"citation-key":"romeiClinicalPathologicalGenetic2018","container-title":"Oncology Letters","container-title-short":"Oncol Lett","DOI":"10.3892/ol.2018.8470","ISSN":"1792-1074","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6]]},"language":"eng","page":"9174-9182","PMCID":"PMC5958691","PMID":"29805648","source":"PubMed","title":"Clinical, pathological and genetic features of anaplastic and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer: A single institute experience","title-short":"Clinical, pathological and genetic features of anaplastic and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

The 12-Item Short Form Health Survey physical and mental component scores remained above baseline, with week 123 mean change (SE) exceeding clinically important changes of 3.9 for physical and 2.8 for mental component scores at 4.7 (2.8) and 3.8 (5.7) points, respectively. EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale, scoring patients' self-rated health, also remained above baseline with a change of 17.1 (5.6) points at week 135. Patient Global Impression of (fatigue) Severity improved vs baseline, corroborating FACIT-Fatigue scores. Patient Global Impression of Change indicated a reduction in perceived disease burden. Data from CARDINAL part B support sustained alleviation of CAD disease burden after long-term treatment with sutimlimab over 2 years, returning toward baseline upon treatment cessation.

  {"id":"rothRandomizedClinicalTrial1988","abstract":"Thirty-nine patients with potentially resectable cancer of the middle or lower esophagus who had not previously been treated were randomly assigned to receive either immediate operation (n = 20) or operation plus preoperative and postoperative therapy with cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin (n = 19). Patients were stratified by tumor size and location and by sex, with no significant differences appearing between the two treatment groups. Median follow-up for both groups was 30 months. The preoperative response rate to chemotherapy was 47%. The postoperative complication rate for patients in the operation-only group was 47%; it was 29% for patients receiving chemotherapy. The overall resectability rates were similar for the two groups. Patients responding to chemotherapy preoperatively had significantly prolonged survival (median greater than 20 months) when compared with either nonresponders (median 6.2 months) or patients receiving only operation (median 8.6 months). A highly significant correlation was noted between a weight loss of less than 10% and response to chemotherapy, which suggested that responses occurred in patients with less advanced disease. We conclude that preoperative and postoperative cisplatin, vindesine, and bleomycin chemotherapy has acceptable toxicity and does not increase the incidence of postoperative complications. The natural history of epidermoid carcinoma of the esophagus is altered and overall survival is prolonged for patients responding to preoperative chemotherapy. Potential responding patients can be identified by the degree of preoperative weight loss.","author":[{"family":"Roth","given":"J. A."},{"family":"Pass","given":"H.

In Part A (26 weeks) of the open-label, single-arm, Phase 3 CARDINAL study in patients with CAD and a recent history of transfusion, sutimlimab demonstrated rapid effects on hemolysis and anemia. Results of the CARDINAL study Part B (2-year extension) study, described herein, demonstrated that sutimlimab sustains improvements in hemolysis, anemia, and quality of life over a median of 144 weeks of treatment. Mean last-available on-treatment values in Part B were improved from baseline for hemoglobin (12.2 g/dL on-treatment versus 8.6 g/dL at baseline), bilirubin (16.5 μmol/L on-treatment versus 52.1 μmol/L at baseline), and FACIT-Fatigue scores (40.5 on-treatment versus 32.4 at baseline). In the 9-week follow-up period after sutimlimab cessation, CP inhibition was reversed, and hemolytic markers and fatigue scores approached pre-sutimlimab values. Overall, sutimlimab was generally well tolerated in Part B. All 22 patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE); 12 (54.5%) patients experienced ≥1 serious TEAE, including seven (31.8%) with ≥1 serious infection. Three patients discontinued due to a TEAE. No patients developed systemic lupus erythematosus or meningococcal infections. After cessation of sutimlimab, most patients reported adverse events consistent with recurrence of CAD.

  {"id":"rubinsteinStandardizingChemotherapyRegimen2020","abstract":"PURPOSE: Due to decades of nonstandardized approaches to the naming of chemotherapy regimens, representation in electronic health records and secondary systems is highly variable. This hampers efforts to understand patterns of chemotherapy usage at the population level. In this article, we describe a proposal for rules to standardize the nomenclature of chemotherapy regimens and illustrate applications of these rules.\nMETHODS: Through our experience with building HemOnc.org, which has been under construction since 2011, we formulated a set of guidelines and recommendations for the standard representation of chemotherapy regimen names. We then performed a mapping between the HemOnc and National Cancer Institute Thesaurus vocabulary's regimens and evaluated conformance with the naming conventions. Finally, we assembled a database of acronyms and names for multiple myeloma regimens to illustrate the scope of the problem.\nRESULTS: For the first use case, 242 of 527 (45.1%) of the regimen names differed. The schema was able to allocate a preferred source for 217 (89.4%) of these regimens. For the second use case, we expanded 130 multiple myeloma regimens to 1,138 unique regimen names and demonstrate ways in which the schema can collapse these into disambiguated, but abbreviated, regimen names.\nCONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first proposal to normalize chemotherapy regimen nomenclature. If our recommendations are adopted, we expect that the uniformity of treatment exposure representation in hematology/oncology will increase, which will enable large-scale efforts such as ASCO's CancerLinQ to achieve better standardization.","author":[{"family":"Rubinstein","given":"Samuel M."},{"family":"Yang","given":"Peter C."},{"family":"Cowan","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Warner","given":"Jeremy L."}],"citation-key":"rubinsteinStandardizingChemotherapyRegimen2020","container-title":"JCO clinical cancer informatics","container-title-short":"JCO Clin Cancer Inform","DOI":"10.1200/CCI.19.00122","ISSN":"2473-4276","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"60-70","PMCID":"PMC7000232","PMID":"31990580","source":"PubMed","title":"Standardizing Chemotherapy Regimen Nomenclature: A Proposal and Evaluation of the HemOnc and National Cancer Institute Thesaurus Regimen Content","title-short":"Standardizing Chemotherapy Regimen Nomenclature","type":"article-journal","volume":"4"},

The obtained data indicate a memory cell-type origin of the B-CLL cells. Remarkably, the IgV(kappa) genes of the B-CLL cells showed intraclonal diversity, whereas the mutational pattern of their paired IgV(H) genes were invariant. Thus, the light-chain-restricted intraclonal diversity in individual leukemic B cells in this patient strongly indicates a differential regulation or selection of the ongoing mutational process.

  {"id":"saharaSystemicTherapiesSalivary2021","abstract":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a slow growing, but relentless cancer. Due to its rarity and lack of understanding of its molecular etiology, no standard chemotherapy for ACC currently exists and many patients suffer from recurrent and/or metastatic disease. As such, development of safe and effective therapies is imperative. To describe and summarize existing clinical trial studies and preclinical discoveries, we surveyed the PubMed on developmental therapeutics for ACC. Objective response rates to monotherapy with cytotoxic agents were approximately 10% with cisplatin, 5-FU, gemcitabine, mitoxantrone, epirubicin, vinorelbine and paclitaxel. The most studied combination therapies were cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-cisplatin (CAP) and cisplatin-vinorelbine, with an objective response rate of 18-31%. Among molecularly targeted drugs, the most studied drugs are inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Among those, lenvatinib and axitinib showed a relatively high objective response rate of 11-16% and 9-17%, respectively. Given high recurrence rates and chemoresistance of ACC, treatments targeting cancer stem cells (CSC), which function as tumor-initiating cells and drive chemoresistance, may be particularly valuable. CSC have been shown to be targetable via MYB, Notch1, p53 and epigenetic mechanisms. Myb overexpression is characteristic in ACC but was previously thought to present a difficult target due to its nature as a transcription factor. However, due to the development Myb-targeted inhibitors and an ongoing clinical trial of MYB-targeted cancer vaccine therapy, MYB is becoming an increasingly attractive therapeutic target. Drugs targeting NOTCH signaling demonstrated 5-17% response rate in phase I clinical trials. Within the field of epigenetics, treatment with PRMT5 inhibitors has shown 21% partial response rate in phase I clinical trial. Immunotherapies, such as PD-1 inhibitors, are also associated with CSC, but have not been effective against ACC. However, clinical trials of cancer vaccine therapies are actively being conducted. In addition to conventional chemotherapies and inhibitors of angiogenesis, the emergence of new therapies such as immunotherapy and those targeting cancer stemness is expected to bring clinical benefits to patients in the future.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Sahara","given":"Sosuke"},{"family":"Herzog","given":"Alexandra E"},{"family":"Nör","given":"Jacques E"}],"citation-key":"saharaSystemicTherapiesSalivary2021","container-title":"American Journal of Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Am J Cancer Res","ISSN":"2156-6976","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,15]]},"page":"4092-4110","PMCID":"PMC8493384","PMID":"34659878","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Systemic therapies for salivary gland adenoid cystic carcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8493384/","volume":"11"},

Generally speaking, these algorithms are trained for one specific task, e.g. to classify between two or multiple types of underlying tumor biology (e.g. hypoxia, HPV status), predict overall survival (OS) or progression free survival (PFS), automatically segment a region of interest e.g. an organ at risk for radiotherapy dose or the gross tumor volume (GTV). Despite relatively good performances in external validation cohorts these algorithms still have not found their way into routine clinical practice. The reason this has not happened yet is complex, multifactorial, and can be usually divided into three categories: technical (a part of the algorithm or pre-processing step is not technically sound), statistical (mainly related to selection of subset of relevant biomarkers), and translational (not enough understanding by clinicians, not easily implementable within clinical workflow). We currently foresee that the next artificial intelligence (AI)-driven technique to find its way into clinical practice beside existing techniques (e.g. automatic organ at risk segmentation) will be the automatic segmentation of head and neck gross tumor volumes.","author":[{"family":"Sanduleanu","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Keek","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Hoezen","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Lambin","given":"Philippe"}],"citation-key":"sanduleanuBiomarkersHypoxiaHPVness2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_2","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

From July 1980 to December 1981, we carried out endoscopic laser treatment for 31 patients with 33 lesions. Bleeding gastric ulcers except stomal ulcers were treated successfully. For mucosal lesions of the stomach, Nd:YAG laser irradiation was effective in extirpating them. In advanced gastric cancers, symptoms of cardiac stenosis could be relieved in 80% of the cases.

  {"id":"savageFavorableOutcomePrimary2006","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) is a distinct clinico-pathological subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The optimal treatment is unknown, with some studies suggesting a superior outcome with dose-intensive chemotherapy regimens, and the role of radiotherapy remains ill-defined.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The British Columbia Cancer Agency lymphoma database was searched and records reviewed to identify those patients presenting with a prominent mediastinal mass and considered to be PMBCL based on the current REAL/WHO classifications. Patients were treated based on era-specific BCCA guidelines (1980-1992 MACOPB/VACOPB; 1992-2001 CHOP-type; 2001-present CHOP-R). Beginning in January 1998 involved-field radiotherapy was recommended to be routinely administered following chemotherapy. Prior to this, use of radiotherapy was individualized in advanced disease.\nRESULTS: In total, 153 patients with newly diagnosed PMBCL were identified between 28 July 1980 and 30 June 2003. The median age was 37 years (range 13-82) and the majority had stage I/II (74%), bulky mediastinal disease (75%). Overall (OS) and progression-free (PFS) survival at 5 years for the entire cohort were 75% and 69%, respectively. In direct comparison with a cohort of patients with DLBCL (n = 1273), OS (P = 10(-4)) and PFS (P = 0.0001) favored PMBCL. The age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (aaIPI) was not predictive of survival (P = 0.18). Five-year OS in patients < 65 years old treated with MACOPB/VACOPB, CHOP-R and CHOP-type was 87%, 81% and 71% respectively (P = 0.048). In pair-wise survival comparisons, only MACOPB/VACOPB and CHOP-type treated patients were significantly different (P = 0.016). In Cox multiple regression analysis, poor performance status remained the only predictor of survival, with treatment received demonstrating a trend to worse outcome for patients treated with CHOP-type regimens (P = 0.09). In an intention-to-treat analysis comparing the era before radiotherapy was routinely administered with after, there was no significant difference in 5-year PFS (74% versus 62%; P = 0.09) or OS (78% versus 69%; P = 0.14).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this single institution, population-based retrospective study, we found that PMBCL patients have excellent survival rates and a distinct plateau is observed in PFS, in striking comparison to DLBCL. The aaIPI was not predictive of survival in this population, suggesting that other prognostic models may be better suited for risk stratification. Dose-intensified chemotherapy with MACOPB or VACOPB demonstrated a trend to superior outcome over CHOP-type chemotherapy. However, further randomized studies are needed and the impact of rituximab on these comparisons must be considered. Finally, the routine addition of radiotherapy does not improve survival.","author":[{"family":"Savage","given":"K.

  {"id":"schmidEventfreeSurvivalPembrolizumab2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: The addition of pembrolizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy led to a significantly higher percentage of patients with early triple-negative breast cancer having a pathological complete response (defined as no invasive cancer in the breast and negative nodes) at definitive surgery in an earlier analysis of this phase 3 trial of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy. The primary results regarding event-free survival in this trial have not been reported.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, patients with previously untreated stage II or III triple-negative breast cancer to receive neoadjuvant therapy with four cycles of pembrolizumab (at a dose of 200 mg) or placebo every 3 weeks plus paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by four cycles of pembrolizumab or placebo plus doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide or epirubicin-cyclophosphamide. After definitive surgery, patients received adjuvant pembrolizumab (pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group) or placebo (placebo-chemotherapy group) every 3 weeks for up to nine cycles. The primary end points were pathological complete response (the results for which have been reported previously) and event-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to the date of disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, occurrence of a second primary cancer, or death from any cause. Safety was also assessed.\nRESULTS: Of the 1174 patients who underwent randomization, 784 were assigned to the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group and 390 to the placebo-chemotherapy group. The median follow-up at this fourth planned interim analysis (data cutoff, March 23, 2021) was 39.1 months. The estimated event-free survival at 36 months was 84.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.7 to 86.9) in the pembrolizumab-chemotherapy group, as compared with 76.8% (95% CI, 72.2 to 80.7) in the placebo-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for event or death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.82; P<0.001). Adverse events occurred predominantly during the neoadjuvant phase and were consistent with the established safety profiles of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy.\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with early triple-negative breast cancer, neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab after surgery, resulted in significantly longer event-free survival than neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.

  {"id":"schoenfeldPneumonitisResultingRadiation2019","abstract":"Background Pneumonitis is a potential consequence of both lung-directed radiation and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), particularly treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Significant morbidity and mortality can result, and severe pneumonitis attributed to ICB precludes continued therapy. Thus, discriminating between radiation- and ICB- related pneumonitis is of importance for the increasing number of patients receiving both treatments. Furthermore, data are limited regarding the interplay between radiation- and ICB-induced lung injury, and which biomarkers might be associated with toxicity.\nCase presentation We report longitudinal clinical and radiologic data, and circulating biomarkers in a melanoma patient treated with axillary radiation followed by ICB who developed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGO) within the radiation field suggestive of radiation-pneumonitis followed by consolidation outside of the radiation field suggestive of ICB-related pneumonitis. Of note, symptomatic radiation-pneumonitis developed despite a low radiation dose to the lung (V20 < 8%), and ICB-related pneumonitis was limited to the ipsilateral lung, suggesting additive effect of radiation and ICB in the development of lung injury. Circulating biomarker analyses demonstrated increases in CXCR2, IL1ra and IL2ra that coincided with the development of symptomatic pneumonitis.\nConclusions These data highlight the imaging findings associated with radiation and ICB-related lung toxicity, and anecdotally describe a clinical course with circulating biomarker correlates. This information can help guide clinical evaluation and future research investigations into the toxicity of combined radiation immunotherapy approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Schoenfeld","given":"Jonathan D."},{"family":"Nishino","given":"Mizuki"},{"family":"Severgnini","given":"Mariano"},{"family":"Manos","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Mak","given":"Raymond H."},{"family":"Hodi","given":"F.

  {"id":"seamanEffectRadiationEsophagus1957","abstract":"IT HAS BEEN repeatedly shown that with supervoltage equipment it is possible to damage deep-seated organs without injuring the skin. The total dosage that can be delivered to a neoplasm is thus no longer dependent upon skin tolerance but upon the tolerance of deep-lying tissues in the path of the beam. Since any tissue can be destroyed by radiation, the definition of radioresistance is a relative matter; in the past it has been defined chiefly in relation to skin tolerance. Since the advent of supervoltage therapy, there is an urgent need for quantitative knowledge regarding the dose of radiation that the different tissues can tolerate without irreversible changes that result in serious loss of function.\n\nIn our experience in the treatment of intrathoracic cancer with the betatron, a major limiting factor has been the tolerance of the esophagus. During the past two years, among the patients whom we have treated for carcinoma of the lung, there were 20 who could not be adequately treated without inclusion of the esophagus within the irradiated volume. With one exception, none of this number had known esophageal extension of their disease or dysphagia prior to therapy. All exhibited clinical evidence of radiation esophagitis of varying degree. In 11 patients, the reaction was considered to be mild. This consisted of slight to moderate substernal burning beginning usually in the third week of therapy and continuing for several weeks after the completion of treatment. The pain was not severe enough to interfere seriously with nutrition but frequently required some dietary modification. Four experienced moderately severe reactions characterized by more severe pain on swallowing and lasting for two to three months after the end of therapy. Five severe reactions were manifested by marked dysphagia and the development of permanent organic strictures requiring dilatation. In 2 instances, a tracheo-esophageal fistula developed.\n\nThe time of initial appearance of the dysphagia varied from the twelfth to the thirtieth day after the initiation of therapy, after the esophagus had received doses varying from 2,000 to 2,500 r in two weeks to 4,000 to 4,500 r in four weeks. The dysphagia was characterized by substernal burning following the ingestion of either solid or liquid food and lasting for several minutes or more after each swallow. In a few instances, there was only an awareness that food was passing down the esophagus. In more severe cases, the pain radiated into the chest and up into the neck and post-auricular region.\n\nMost of these patients were treated in 1954, when all of the available clinical data and animal experiments indicated that the 24-MEV x-ray beam produced by the betatron was biologically less efficient than 200-kv x-rays. At that time the report of Quastler and others (3, 4, 12, 14-18) indicated that the relative biologic efficiency for 24-MEV x-rays was from 0 6 to 0.8.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Seaman","given":"William B."},{"family":"Ackerman","given":"Lauren V."}],"citation-key":"seamanEffectRadiationEsophagus1957","container-title":"Radiology","DOI":"10.1148/68.4.534","ISSN":"0033-8419","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["1957",4]]},"page":"534-541","publisher":"Radiological Society of North America","source":"pubs.rsna.org (Atypon)","title":"The Effect of Radiation on the Esophagus","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/68.4.534","volume":"68"},

Some have recommended that patients with chronic reflux\nsymptoms undergo upper endoscopy to assess for Barrett esophagus and to screen\nfor cancer.ObjectivesTo review the evidence linking GERD and Barrett esophagus to esophageal\nadenocarcinoma and to examine the utility of upper endoscopy as a screening\ntool in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus among individuals with GERD.Data SourcesA MEDLINE search was performed to identify all pertinent English-language\nreports about GERD, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett esophagus from 1968 through\n2001. Reports were of randomized controlled clinical trials if available,\ncase-control data if trials were unavailable, and cohort studies if case-control\ndata were unavailable. Pertinent bibliographies were also reviewed to find\nreports not otherwise identified.Study Selection and Data ExtractionStudies were selected by using the search terms gastroesophageal\nreflux, adenocarcinoma, and Barrett's esophagus, with subheadings for classification, complications,\ndrug therapy, economics, epidemiology, mortality, surgery, and prevention\nand control. Clinical guidelines for the care of subjects with GERD and Barrett\nesophagus were retrieved and abstracted.Data SynthesisCohort studies demonstrate that symptoms of GERD occur monthly in almost\n50% of US adults and weekly in almost 20%. Three large case-control studies\ndemonstrate a positive association between reflux symptoms and risk of adenocarcinoma\nof the esophagus, with more prolonged and severe symptoms accentuating this\nrisk. However, because of the low incidence of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus\nand the ubiquity of reflux symptoms, the risk of cancer in any given individual\nwith reflux symptoms is low. No randomized trial data are available to demonstrate\neither decreased cancer incidence or increased life expectancy in subjects\nwith GERD who undergo screening endoscopy.ConclusionsStrong evidence supports the association of GERD and adenocarcinoma\nof the esophagus; however, the risk of cancer in any given individual with\nGERD is low. Barrett esophagus appears to be a common precursor lesion to\nthis cancer. Given the low absolute risk of cancer in those with GERD and\nthe lack of demonstrated efficacy of endoscopic screening, insufficient evidence\nexists to endorse routine endoscopic screening of patients with chronic GERD\nsymptoms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Shaheen","given":"Nicholas"},{"family":"Ransohoff","given":"David F."}],"citation-key":"shaheenGastroesophagealRefluxBarrett2002","container-title":"JAMA","container-title-short":"JAMA","DOI":"10.1001/jama.287.15.1972","ISSN":"0098-7484","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",4,17]]},"page":"1972-1981","source":"Silverchair","title":"Gastroesophageal Reflux, Barrett Esophagus, and Esophageal CancerScientific Review","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.287.15.1972","volume":"287"},
  {"id":"shahImprovingOutcomesPatients2023","abstract":"The care of patients with oesophageal cancer or of individuals who have an elevated risk of oesophageal cancer has changed dramatically. The epidemiology of squamous cell and adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus has diverged over the past several decades, with a marked increase in incidence only for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Only in the past decade, however, have molecular features that distinguish these two forms of the disease been identified. This advance has the potential to improve screening for oesophageal cancers through the development of novel minimally invasive diagnostic technologies predicated on cancer-specific genomic or epigenetic alterations. Surgical techniques have also evolved towards less invasive approaches associated with less morbidity, without compromising oncological outcomes. With improvements in multidisciplinary care, advances in radiotherapy and new tools to detect minimal residual disease, certain patients may no longer even require surgical tumour resection. However, perhaps the most anticipated advance in the treatment of patients with oesophageal cancer is the advent of immune-checkpoint inhibitors, which harness and enhance the host immune response against cancer. In this Review, we discuss all these advances in the management of oesophageal cancer, representing only the beginning of a transformation in our quest to improve patient outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Manish A."},{"family":"Altorki","given":"Nasser"},{"family":"Patel","given":"Pretish"},{"family":"Harrison","given":"Sebron"},{"family":"Bass","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Abrams","given":"Julian A."}],"citation-key":"shahImprovingOutcomesPatients2023","container-title":"Nature Reviews Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"Nat Rev Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1038/s41571-023-00757-y","ISSN":"1759-4782","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,21]]},"language":"en","license":"2023 Springer Nature Limited","page":"1-18","source":"www.nature.com","title":"Improving outcomes in patients with oesophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41571-023-00757-y"},

Historically, patients with PMBCL were treated with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) chemotherapy ± involved field radiation. Since a phase II trial, published in April 2013, demonstrated excellent results using dose-adjusted (DA) R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin), this treatment has gained popularity. We performed a retrospective, multicentre analysis of patients aged ≥18 years with PMBCL since January 2011. Patients were stratified by frontline regimen, R-CHOP versus DA-R-EPOCH. 132 patients were identified from 11 contributing centres (56 R-CHOP and 76 DA-R-EPOCH). The primary outcome was overall survival. Secondary outcomes included progression-free survival, complete response (CR) rate, and rates of treatment-related complications. Demographic characteristics were similar in both groups. DA-R-EPOCH use increased after April 2013 (79% vs. 45%, P < 0·001), and there was less radiation use after DA-R-EPOCH (13% vs. 59%, P < 0·001). While CR rates were higher with DA-R-EPOCH (84% vs. 70%, P = 0·046), these patients were more likely to experience treatment-related toxicities. At 2 years, 89% of R-CHOP patients and 91% of DA-R-EPOCH patients were alive. To our knowledge, this represents the largest series comparing outcomes of R-CHOP to DA-R-EPOCH for PMBCL.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Shah","given":"Nirav N."},{"family":"Szabo","given":"Aniko"},{"family":"Huntington","given":"Scott F."},{"family":"Epperla","given":"Narendranath"},{"family":"Reddy","given":"Nishitha"},{"family":"Ganguly","given":"Siddhartha"},{"family":"Vose","given":"Julie"},{"family":"Obiozor","given":"Cynthia"},{"family":"Faruqi","given":"Fahad"},{"family":"Kovach","given":"Alexandra E."},{"family":"Costa","given":"Luciano J."},{"family":"Xavier","given":"Ana C."},{"family":"Okal","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Kanate","given":"Abraham S."},{"family":"Ghosh","given":"Nilanjan"},{"family":"Kharfan-Dabaja","given":"Mohamed A."},{"family":"Strelec","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Hamadani","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Fenske","given":"Timothy S."},{"family":"Calzada","given":"Oscar"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Jonathon B."},{"family":"Chavez","given":"Julio"},{"family":"Svoboda","given":"Jakub"}],"citation-key":"shahRCHOPDoseadjustedREPOCH2018","container-title":"British Journal of Haematology","DOI":"10.1111/bjh.15051","ISSN":"1365-2141","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","page":"534-544","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"R-CHOP versus dose-adjusted R-EPOCH in frontline management of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma: a multi-centre analysis","title-short":"R-CHOP versus dose-adjusted R-EPOCH in frontline management of primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjh.15051","volume":"180"},

  {"id":"sheikhCurrentStatusFuture2023","abstract":"Esophageal cancer (EC) is the ninth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are the two main histological subtypes with distinct epidemiological and clinical features. While the global incidence of ESCC is declining, the incidence of EAC is increasing in many countries. Decades of epidemiologic research have identified distinct environmental exposures for ESCC and EAC subtypes. Recent advances in understanding the genomic aspects of EC have advanced our understanding of EC causes and led to using specific genomic alterations in EC tumors as biomarkers for early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this cancer. Nevertheless, the prognosis of EC is still poor, with a five-year survival rate of less than 20%. Currently, there are significant challenges for early detection and secondary prevention for both ESCC and EAC subtypes, but Cytosponge™ is shifting this position for EAC. Primary prevention remains the preferred strategy for reducing the global burden of EC. In this review, we will summarize recent advances, current status, and future prospects of the studies related to epidemiology, time trends, environmental risk factors, prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment for both EC subtypes.","author":[{"family":"Sheikh","given":"Mahdi"},{"family":"Roshandel","given":"Gholamreza"},{"family":"McCormack","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Malekzadeh","given":"Reza"}],"citation-key":"sheikhCurrentStatusFuture2023","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15030765","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,26]]},"language":"eng","page":"765","PMCID":"PMC9913274","PMID":"36765722","source":"PubMed","title":"Current Status and Future Prospects for Esophageal Cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"shenTislelizumabChemotherapySecondLine2022","abstract":"PURPOSE: Patients with advanced or metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have poor prognosis. For these patients, treatment options are limited after first-line systemic therapy.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label phase III clinical study, patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC, whose tumor progressed after first-line systemic treatment, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibody, 200 mg every 3 weeks or chemotherapy (investigator's choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or irinotecan). The primary end point was overall survival (OS) in all patients. The key secondary end point was OS in patients with programmed death-ligand 1 tumor area positivity (TAP) score ≥ 10%.\nRESULTS: In total, 512 patients across 11 countries/regions were randomly assigned. At final analysis, conducted after 410 death events occurred, OS was significantly longer with tislelizumab versus chemotherapy in all patients (median, 8.6 v 6.3 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.85]; one-sided P = .0001), and in patients with TAP ≥ 10% (median, 10.3 months v 6.8 months; HR, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.79]; one-sided P = .0006). Survival benefit was consistently observed across all predefined subgroups, including those defined by baseline TAP score, region, and race. Treatment with tislelizumab was associated with higher objective response rate (20.3% v 9.8%) and a more durable antitumor response (median, 7.1 months v 4.0 months) versus chemotherapy in all patients. Fewer patients experienced ≥ grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (18.8% v 55.8%) with tislelizumab versus chemotherapy.\nCONCLUSION: Tislelizumab significantly improved OS compared with chemotherapy as second-line therapy in patients with advanced or metastatic ESCC, with a tolerable safety profile. Patients with programmed death-ligand 1 TAP ≥ 10% also demonstrated statistically significant survival benefit with tislelizumab versus chemotherapy.","author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Kato","given":"Ken"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sung-Bae"},{"family":"Ajani","given":"Jaffer A."},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Kuaile"},{"family":"He","given":"Zhiyong"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Xinmin"},{"family":"Shu","given":"Yongqian"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jufeng"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Zhendong"},{"family":"Niu","given":"Zuoxing"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Longzhen"},{"family":"Yi","given":"Tienan"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Jong-Mu"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jianhua"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Guohua"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Chen-Yuan"},{"family":"Hara","given":"Hiroki"},{"family":"Bi","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Satoh","given":"Taroh"},{"family":"Pazo-Cid","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Arkenau","given":"Hendrick-Tobias"},{"family":"Borg","given":"Christophe"},{"family":"Lordick","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Liyun"},{"family":"Ding","given":"Ningning"},{"family":"Tao","given":"Aiyang"},{"family":"Shi","given":"Jingwen"},{"family":"Van Cutsem","given":"Eric"},{"literal":"RATIONALE-302 Investigators"}],"citation-key":"shenTislelizumabChemotherapySecondLine2022","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology: Official Journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.21.01926","ISSN":"1527-7755","issue":"26","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,10]]},"language":"eng","page":"3065-3076","PMCID":"PMC9462531","PMID":"35442766","source":"PubMed","title":"Tislelizumab Versus Chemotherapy as Second-Line Treatment for Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (RATIONALE-302): A Randomized Phase III Study","title-short":"Tislelizumab Versus Chemotherapy as Second-Line Treatment for Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (RATIONALE-302)","type":"article-journal","volume":"40"},

  {"id":"smallridgeAnaplasticThyroidCarcinoma2010","abstract":"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma ranges from 1.3 to 9.8% of all thyroid cancers globally. Mutations, amplifications, activation of oncogenes and silencing of tumour suppressor genes contribute to its aggressive behaviour, and recent studies (e.g. microarrays, microRNAs) have provided further insights into its complex molecular dysregulation. Preclinical studies have identified numerous proteins over- or underexpressed that affect critical cellular processes, including transcription, signalling, mitosis, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and adhesion, and a variety of agents that effectively inhibit these processes and tumour growth. In clinical studies of 1771 patients, 64% were women, the median survival was 5 months, and 1-year survival was 20%. The variables associated with survival in some series included age, tumour size, extent of surgery, higher dose radiotherapy, absence of distant metastases at presentation, co-existence of differentiated thyroid cancer and multimodality therapy. However, considerable bias exists in these non-randomised studies. Although more aggressive radiotherapy has reduced locoregional recurrences, the median overall survival has not improved in over 50 years. Newer systemic therapies are being tried, and more effective combinations are needed to improve patient outcomes.","author":[{"family":"Smallridge","given":"R. C."},{"family":"Copland","given":"J.

Management of oesophagogastric cancers is by a multidisciplinary team with utilisation of surgery, radiotherapy and systemic treatments in combinations where appropriate. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has drastically changed the treatment landscape of multiple solid malignancies in the last 5 years. In oesophagogastric cancer, clinical trials have only recently shown activity that is often associated with the molecular characteristics of these tumours, in particular PD-L1 scores or microsatellite instability (MSI-H).

  {"id":"soroushNonAcidFluidExposure2022","abstract":"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for the large majority of esophageal cancer cases worldwide. In this review, we examine the potential role of non-acidic fluid (NAF) exposure in ESCC carcinogenesis. Esophageal NAF consists of a mixture of salivary, esophageal, gastric, and duodenal fluids, containing inflammatory constituents such as digestive enzymes and bile acids that induce DNA damage, as well as known carcinogens such as acetaldehyde and N-nitrosamines. Exposure to NAF can occur in the setting of increased non-acid reflux, decreased gastric acidity, and decreased esophageal fluid clearance. Non-acid reflux has been associated with ESCC in small observational studies, and in animal models bile reflux can promote the development of ESCC. Associations have been found between increased ESCC risk and atrophic gastritis, a history of partial gastrectomy, and proton pump inhibitor use, all of which raise the pH of refluxate. Additionally, a minimally or non-acidic gastric environment contains an altered microbiome that can increase the production of acetaldehyde and N-nitrosamines. Esophageal motility disorders such as achalasia and opioid-induced esophageal dysfunction result in increased stasis and exposure to these potentially proinflammatory constituents of NAF. NAF may promote the development of ESCC via multiple mechanisms and is an understudied area of research.","author":[{"family":"Soroush","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Etemadi","given":"Arash"},{"family":"Abrams","given":"Julian A."}],"citation-key":"soroushNonAcidFluidExposure2022","container-title":"Digestive Diseases and Sciences","container-title-short":"Dig Dis Sci","DOI":"10.1007/s10620-021-07127-7","ISSN":"1573-2568","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"2754-2762","PMID":"34236559","source":"PubMed","title":"Non-Acid Fluid Exposure and Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"67"},

The extra-nodal variant of lymphoma is rare, but it is the most common non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (ENHL). Furthermore, it is difficult to diagnose due to its non-specific clinical and radiological features, which can mimic other benign or malignant clinical manifestations. The study: This retrospective study involved 72 patients affected by head and neck ENHL in the period between 2003 and 2017. All patients underwent a diagnostic-therapeutic procedure according to the guidelines, and a 5-year follow-up. Based on the location of the swelling at the time of diagnosis, patients were divided into two groups: oral and non-oral ENHLs. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier analysis with the log-rank test. In addition, Fisher’s exact test was applied to the two groups to evaluate and compare variances (the acceptable significance level was set at p < 0.05). Conclusion: ENHL with oral localization is much more aggressive than ENHL with non-oral localization, with a death rate of 40% (versus 4.76 for the non-oral one). In fact, between the two groups, there is a statistically significant difference in mortality, with a p-value of 0.0001 and 0.0002, respectively.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",3,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Sorrentino","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Ferragina","given":"Francesco"},{"family":"Barca","given":"Ida"},{"family":"Arrotta","given":"Antonella"},{"family":"Cristofaro","given":"Maria Giulia"}],"citation-key":"sorrentinoExtraNodalLymphomasHead2022","container-title":"Current Oncology","DOI":"10.3390/curroncol29100566","ISSN":"1718-7729","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",10]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"10","page":"7189-7197","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Extra-Nodal Lymphomas of the Head and Neck and Oral Cavity: A Retrospective Study","title-short":"Extra-Nodal Lymphomas of the Head and Neck and Oral Cavity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1718-7729/29/10/566","volume":"29"},
  {"id":"sparanoLimitedEfficacyLenvatinib2021","abstract":"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a rare lethal disease. Lenvatinib is an off-label therapeutic option for ATC in most countries, except in Japan. The aim of this multicenter retrospective survey was to analyze the efficacy and the toxicity profile of off-label lenvatinib treatment in all adults advanced ATC patients, in France. Of the 23 patients analysed (14 males; mean age 64 years), 15 were pure ATC and 8 were mixed tumors (i.e. with a differentiated or poorly differentiated component). Prior treatments included neck external beam irradiation in 74%, at least one line of chemotherapy in 22 cases, two lines of chemotherapy in 11 patients, other TKI in 4 cases. A central RECIST assessment was performed. Since lenvatinib initiation, median PFS was 2.7 months (95% CI; 1.9-3.5) and median OS was 3.1 months (95% CI; 0.6-5.5). OS was significantly longer in case of mixed tumors compared with pure ATC (6.3 vs 2.7 months, P = 0.026). Best tumor response was partial response in two cases and stable disease in seven. Clinical improvement was achieved in seven patients. Lethal adverse events occurred in three patients, consisting in haemoptysis in two cases and pneumothorax in one case. Among long-surviving ATC patients (>6 months), four underwent biopsy of distant metastasis, revealing poorly differentiated histology; three of them had initial mixed ATC histology. Efficacy of lenvatinib appears limited, although pure vs mixed ATC disclose differences in disease aggressiveness and treatment response. Long-surviving ATC patients might benefit from biopsy of persistent disease, searching for histological transition or molecular target.","author":[{"family":"Sparano","given":"Clotilde"},{"family":"Godbert","given":"Yann"},{"family":"Attard","given":"Marie"},{"family":"Do Cao","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Zerdoud","given":"Slimane"},{"family":"Roudaut","given":"Nathalie"},{"family":"Joly","given":"Charlotte"},{"family":"Berdelou","given":"Amandine"},{"family":"Hadoux","given":"Julien"},{"family":"Lamartina","given":"Livia"},{"family":"Schlumberger","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Leboulleux","given":"Sophie"}],"citation-key":"sparanoLimitedEfficacyLenvatinib2021","container-title":"Endocrine-Related Cancer","container-title-short":"Endocr Relat Cancer","DOI":"10.1530/ERC-20-0106","ISSN":"1479-6821","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"15-26","PMID":"33112817","source":"PubMed","title":"Limited efficacy of lenvatinib in heavily pretreated anaplastic thyroid cancer: a French overview","title-short":"Limited efficacy of lenvatinib in heavily pretreated anaplastic thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"28"},

  {"id":"steigerEradicationPalliationSquamous1981","abstract":"Between April, 1977, and March, 1981, 86 unselected patients with proved squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by operation whenever feasible. The preoperative chemotherapeutic agents used initially were 5-fluorouracil, and mitomycin C. After December, 1979, cis-platinum was used instead of mitomycin C. Radiotherapy (3,000 rads) of the tumor was begun at the same time as the chemotherapy. An esophagectomy was performed on suitable candidates 3 to 4 weeks after the chemotherapy and radiotherapy were completed. The mucosal lesion disappeared in 69 of the 86 patients, and dysphagia was relieved at least temporarily in 57 of 62 patients. Recurrent dysphagia resulting from fibrosis at the tumor site caused a secondary stenosis in 11 patients. Excellent palliation was obtained in five patients with bronchoesophageal fistulas who had an initial substernal gastric bypass followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Of the 48 patients who had an esophagectomy, 15 (31%) had no tumor in the resected specimen. Eleven of these 15 patients are still alive with no evidence of disease. All patients with a lesion less than 5.0 cm in length had complete regression of the tumor. We believe that this combination of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgical therapy provides excellent palliation, increases resectability, and has a potential for cure.","author":[{"family":"Steiger","given":"Z."},{"family":"Franklin","given":"R."},{"family":"Wilson","given":"R.

Mutations in the BRAF gene have been found in 5% of biliary tract tumours. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has shown activity in several BRAFV600E-mutated cancers. We aimed to assess the activity and safety of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer.\nMETHODS: This study is part of an ongoing, phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, Rare Oncology Agnostic Research (ROAR) basket trial in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated rare cancers. Patients were eligible for the biliary tract cancer cohort if they were aged 18 years or older, had BRAFV600E-mutated, unresectable, metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent biliary tract cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received previous systemic treatment. All patients were treated with oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and oral trametinib 2 mg once daily until disease progression or intolerance of treatment. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate, which was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat evaluable population, which comprised all enrolled patients regardless of receiving treatment who were evaluable (ie, had progression, began a new anticancer treatment, withdrew consent, died, had stable disease for 6 weeks or longer, or had two or more post-baseline assessments). The ROAR trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02034110. These results are based on an interim analysis; the study is active but not recruiting.\nFINDINGS: Between March 12, 2014, and July 18, 2018, 43 patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer were enrolled to the study and were evaluable. Median follow-up was 10 months (IQR 6-15). An investigator-assessed overall response was achieved by 22 (51%, 95% CI 36-67) of 43 patients. An independent reviewer-assessed overall response was achieved by 20 (47%, 95% CI 31-62) of 43 patients.

We report an updated analysis describing the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib plus trametinib in the full ROAR ATC cohort of 36 patients with ∼4 years of additional study follow-up.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: ROAR (NCT02034110) is an open-label, nonrandomized, phase II basket study evaluating dabrafenib plus trametinib in BRAF V600E-mutant rare cancers. The ATC cohort comprised 36 patients with unresectable or metastatic ATC who received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily plus trametinib 2 mg once daily orally until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or death. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Secondary endpoints were duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety.\nRESULTS: At data cutoff (14 September 2020), median follow-up was 11.1 months (range, 0.9-76.6 months). The investigator-assessed ORR was 56% (95% confidence interval, 38.1% to 72.1%), including three complete responses; the 12-month DOR rate was 50%. Median PFS and OS were 6.7 and 14.5 months, respectively. The respective 12-month PFS and OS rates were 43.2% and 51.7%, and the 24-month OS rate was 31.5%. No new safety signals were identified with additional follow-up, and adverse events were consistent with the established tolerability of dabrafenib plus trametinib.\nCONCLUSIONS: These updated results confirm the substantial clinical benefit and manageable toxicity of dabrafenib plus trametinib in BRAF V600E-mutant ATC. Dabrafenib plus trametinib notably improved long-term survival and represents a meaningful treatment option for this rare, aggressive cancer.","author":[{"family":"Subbiah","given":"V."},{"family":"Kreitman","given":"R.

  {"id":"subbiahDabrafenibTrametinibTreatment2018","abstract":"Purpose We report the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor) combination therapy in BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer, a rare, aggressive, and highly lethal malignancy with poor patient outcomes and no systemic therapies with clinical benefit. Methods In this phase II, open-label trial, patients with predefined BRAF V600E-mutated malignancies received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death. The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results Sixteen patients with BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer were evaluable (median follow-up, 47 weeks; range, 4 to 120 weeks). All patients had received prior radiation treatment and/or surgery, and six had received prior systemic therapy. The confirmed overall response rate was 69% (11 of 16; 95% CI, 41% to 89%), with seven ongoing responses. Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not reached as a result of a lack of events, with 12-month estimates of 90%, 79%, and 80%, respectively. The safety population was composed of 100 patients who were enrolled with seven rare tumor histologies. Common adverse events were fatigue (38%), pyrexia (37%), and nausea (35%). No new safety signals were detected. Conclusion Dabrafenib plus trametinib is the first regimen demonstrated to have robust clinical activity in BRAF V600E-mutated anaplastic thyroid cancer and was well tolerated. These findings represent a meaningful therapeutic advance for this orphan disease.","author":[{"family":"Subbiah","given":"Vivek"},{"family":"Kreitman","given":"Robert J."},{"family":"Wainberg","given":"Zev A."},{"family":"Cho","given":"Jae Yong"},{"family":"Schellens","given":"Jan H.

  {"id":"szturzCisplatinEligibilityIssues2019","abstract":"Well-designed randomized trials provide the highest level of scientific evidence to guide clinical decision making. In chemoradiotherapy of locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), data support the use of three cycles of 100 mg/m2 cisplatin given every 3 weeks concurrently with conventionally fractionated external beam radiotherapy, although a full compliance with all three cycles is reserved to only about two thirds of initially eligible cases. On an individual patient level, practicing oncologists have to determine whether the patient is a suitable candidate for this treatment or whether contraindications exist. In the latter case, an adequate alternative has to be offered. In this regard, to facilitate triaging of medical information, we reviewed available publications on this topic and prepared practice-oriented recommendations for systemic treatment concurrent to definitive and post-operative radiotherapy. Even if no contraindications for the standard-of-care cisplatin apply, clinicians may opt for alternative regimens by adjusting the peak dose, cumulative dose, or timing of cisplatin. Relative contraindications pose the major issue in clinical practice, as very limited data is available in the literature and final decisions are usually based on an expert opinion or retrospective cohort studies. In the case of absolute interdiction of cisplatin, several alternative regimens incorporating carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil, cetuximab, and docetaxel are available. At the same time, it should be kept in mind that radiotherapy alone represents a viable option with hyperfractionation being particularly beneficial in the definitive management of limited nodal disease. Ideally, all treatment propositions should be discussed within multidisciplinary tumor boards taking into account the patient- and disease-related characteristics as well as local logistics and reimbursement policies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Szturz","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Cristina","given":"Valerie"},{"family":"Herrera Gómez","given":"Ruth Gabriela"},{"family":"Bourhis","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Simon","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."}],"citation-key":"szturzCisplatinEligibilityIssues2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2019.00464","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6,11]]},"page":"464","PMCID":"PMC6579895","PMID":"31245288","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Cisplatin Eligibility Issues and Alternative Regimens in Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer: Recommendations for Clinical Practice","title-short":"Cisplatin Eligibility Issues and Alternative Regimens in Locoregionally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6579895/","volume":"9"},
  {"id":"szturzHighDoseThreeWeeklyLowDose2021","abstract":"In locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, adding three cycles of high-dose (100 mg/m2) cisplatin every three weeks to definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy can significantly improve locoregional control and survival. One of the major drawbacks is severe acute toxicity with about 40% of patients developing mucositis, up to one fourth suffering from dysphagia, and at least 20% having bone marrow suppression. Late toxicity has been under- and sometimes mis-reported and may even be responsible for an increase in non-cancer-related deaths in long-term survivors. Moreover, efficacy outcomes are still not satisfactory with 5-year overall survival rates ranging between 40% and 50%, excluding the growing minority of human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer cases with a markedly better prognosis. Consequently, alternative regimens have gained attention with the aim to reduce toxicity, improve adherence, and maintain adequate anti-tumour activity. Low-dose (usually 40 mg/m2) cisplatin given in weekly intervals emerged as the preferred alternative to the standard, high-dose regimen. But do we have enough evidence to support this approach and which patients might become suitable candidates? While the use of high-dose cisplatin is supported by the results of four large trials randomizing altogether 1539 patients between conventionally fractionated chemoradiation and radiotherapy alone, there are only three small, similarly designed but possibly biased studies favouring a weekly regimen. In addition, two other trials randomly assigning patients to receive either high-dose or low-dose cisplatin, provided evidence against routine administration of the latter schedule. Therefore, although weekly cisplatin may enhance short-term tolerance in terms of gastro-intestinal, hepatic, hearing, renal, and haematological side effects, it cannot be excluded that this improvement comes at the price of compromised survival with no benefit in late adverse events. We acknowledge that certain clinical scenarios, particularly in the presence of relative contraindications to high-dose cisplatin, may favour a less toxic cisplatin dose and/or administration schedule, among which the low-dose weekly regimen. In this respect, the ever-growing population of elderly patients is in particular benefitting from a careful decision, taking into account the pros and cons of such regimens.","author":[{"family":"Szturz","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."}],"citation-key":"szturzHighDoseThreeWeeklyLowDose2021","container-title":"Critical Issues in Head and Neck Oncology","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-63234-2_10","editor":[{"family":"Vermorken","given":"Jan B."},{"family":"Budach","given":"Volker"},{"family":"Leemans","given":"C.

The frequency of perforation was not significantly different between the two groups (P = .68). Four independent risk factors for local recurrence were identified by the Cox regression model: EMR, deep cancer invasion, upper esophagus location, and family history of esophageal cancer. Radical cure is mostly obtained by successful endoscopic retreatment of local recurrence after previous endoscopic resection. Disease-free survival was significantly better with ESD.\nLIMITATIONS: The study's retrospective nature prevents definitive conclusions.\nCONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that ESD gives a higher cure rate and is safer than conventional endoscopic resection when applied to early SCCE. ESD warrants prospective comparative studies with conventional endoscopic resection.","author":[{"family":"Takahashi","given":"Hiroaki"},{"family":"Arimura","given":"Yoshiaki"},{"family":"Masao","given":"Hosokawa"},{"family":"Okahara","given":"Satoshi"},{"family":"Tanuma","given":"Tokuma"},{"family":"Kodaira","given":"Junichi"},{"family":"Kagaya","given":"Hidetoshi"},{"family":"Shimizu","given":"Yuichi"},{"family":"Hokari","given":"Kaku"},{"family":"Tsukagoshi","given":"Hiroyuki"},{"family":"Shinomura","given":"Yasuhisa"},{"family":"Fujita","given":"Masahiro"}],"citation-key":"takahashiEndoscopicSubmucosalDissection2010","container-title":"Gastrointestinal Endoscopy","container-title-short":"Gastrointest Endosc","DOI":"10.1016/j.gie.2010.02.040","ISSN":"1097-6779","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"255-264, 264.e1-2","PMID":"20541198","source":"PubMed","title":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection is superior to conventional endoscopic resection as a curative treatment for early squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (with video)","type":"article-journal","volume":"72"},
  {"id":"takeshitaEndoscopicTreatmentEarly1997","abstract":"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic treatment has become increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative to surgical treatment with the hope of offering superior quality of life (QOL) for the patient. The results of endoscopic treatment of mucosal lesions of mostly early oesophageal or gastric cancer performed in 145 patients (155 lesions) over the past eight years were reviewed from the standpoint of QOL. RESULTS: In 56 patients who underwent radical resection of the oesophageal mucosa, no serious complications and symptoms occurred, with epithelialisation completed within about a month. Patients also showed good results regarding dietary intake and performance status (PS), and all are currently alive without any sign of recurrence. One time fractionated endoscopic resection was carried out in about 40% of the 57 patients who underwent gastric mucosal resection. In these 57 patients, an artificial ulcer measuring 3 cm or more was formed, resulting in a favourable outcome after healing. An overwhelming proportion of these subjects had no symptoms and good PS after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of this method, endoscopic mucosal resection using a cap fitted panendoscope, is expected to permit additional indications for endoscopic treatment. Endoscopic Nd-YAG laser irradiation was applied mainly to early gastric cancer lesions (32 patients), usually for relative indications for endoscopic treatment. This procedure is safe and advantageous in that it requires no hospitalisation, permits fractionated irradiation, and secures good QOL.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Takeshita","given":"K"},{"family":"Tani","given":"M"},{"family":"Inoue","given":"H"},{"family":"Saeki","given":"I"},{"family":"Hayashi","given":"S"},{"family":"Honda","given":"T"},{"family":"Kando","given":"F"},{"family":"Saito","given":"N"},{"family":"Endo","given":"M"}],"citation-key":"takeshitaEndoscopicTreatmentEarly1997","container-title":"Gut","container-title-short":"Gut","ISSN":"0017-5749","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",1]]},"page":"123-127","PMCID":"PMC1027021","PMID":"9155589","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Endoscopic treatment of early oesophageal or gastric cancer.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1027021/","volume":"40"},

We analyzed ATC characteristics and survival rates in Sicily to evaluate the possible influence of environmental factors. With this aim, data regarding ATC incidences in urban/rural and industrial, iodine-deficient, and volcanic vs control areas were compared in Sicily as well as ATC data from Sicily and USA.\nMETHODS: Using the Sicilian Register of Thyroid Cancer (SRTC) database incidence, age, gender, tumor size and histotype, extrathyroidal extension, stage, and coexistence with pre-existing differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) were evaluated in different areas of Sicily and also compared with Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data in USA.\nRESULTS: Forty-three ATCs were identified in Sicily in the period 2002-2009. In our series only age <70 years at diagnosis (p = 0.01), coexistence with DTC (p = 0.027) and tumor size ≤6 cm (p = 0.012) were significant factors for increased survival at univariate analysis (only age at multivariate analysis). No difference in ATC incidence was found in urban vs rural areas and in iodine-deficient and industrial vs control areas. By contrast, in the volcanic area of Sicily, where DTC incidence is doubled relative to the rest of the island, also ATC incidence was increased. ATC data in Sicily were similar to those reported in the same period in the USA where overall survival rate at 6 and 12 months, however, was smaller.\nCONCLUSION: The similar ATC data observed in Sicily and USA (having different genetic background and lifestyle) and the increased ATC incidence in the volcanic area of Sicily paralleling the increased incidence of papillary thyroid cancer are compatible with the possibility that casual additional mutations, more frequent in a background of increased cell replication like DCT, are the major causes of ATC rather than genetic background and/or direct environmental influences.","author":[{"family":"Tavarelli","given":"Martina"},{"family":"Malandrino","given":"Pasqualino"},{"family":"Vigneri","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Richiusa","given":"Pierina"},{"family":"Maniglia","given":"Adele"},{"family":"Violi","given":"Maria A."},{"family":"Sapuppo","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Vella","given":"Veronica"},{"family":"Dardanoni","given":"Gabriella"},{"family":"Vigneri","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Pellegriti","given":"Gabriella"}],"citation-key":"tavarelliAnaplasticThyroidCancer2017","container-title":"Frontiers in Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)","DOI":"10.3389/fendo.2017.00277","ISSN":"1664-2392","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"eng","page":"277","PMCID":"PMC5662896","PMID":"29123502","source":"PubMed","title":"Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer in Sicily: The Role of Environmental Characteristics","title-short":"Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer in Sicily","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"teixeirafarinhaImmunotherapyEsophagealCancer2022","abstract":"The management of esophageal cancer (EC) has experienced manifold changes during the last decades. Centralization of EC treatment has been introduced in many countries, subsequently allowing the development of specialized high-volume centers. Minimal invasive surgery has replaced open surgery in many centers, whereas more potent systemic treatments have been introduced in clinical practice. Newer chemotherapy regimens increase long-term survival. Nevertheless, the overall survival of EC patients remains dismal for advanced tumor stages. In this direction, a wide range of targeted biologic agents (immunotherapy) is currently under assessment. Anti- Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER-2) monoclonal antibodies are used in HER2 (+) tumors, predominantly well-differentiated adenocarcinomas, and are currently assessed in the neoadjuvant setting (TRAP, INNOVATION trials). Immune checkpoint inhibitors Nivolumab (ATTRACTION-03) and pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE-181), have demonstrated a survival benefit compared with conventional chemotherapy in heavily pre-treated progressive disease. More recently, CheckMate-577 showed very promising results for nivolumab in a curative adjuvant setting, improving disease-free survival mainly for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Several ongoing trials are investigating novel targeted agents in the preoperative setting of locally advanced EC. In addition, other immunomodulatory approaches such as peptide vaccines and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are currently under development and should be increasingly integrated into clinical practice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Teixeira Farinha","given":"Hugo"},{"family":"Digklia","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Schizas","given":"Dimitrios"},{"family":"Demartines","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Schäfer","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Mantziari","given":"Styliani"}],"citation-key":"teixeirafarinhaImmunotherapyEsophagealCancer2022","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14030554","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"3","page":"554","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Immunotherapy for Esophageal Cancer: State-of-the Art in 2021","title-short":"Immunotherapy for Esophageal Cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/3/554","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"theinEstimatesPredictorsHealth2018","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) incidence is increasing rapidly. Esophageal cancer has the second lowest 5-year survival rate of people diagnosed with cancer in Canada. Given the poor survival and the potential for further increases in incidence, phase-specific cost estimates constitute an important input for economic evaluation of prevention, screening, and treatment interventions. The study aims to estimate phase-specific net direct medical costs of care attributable to EAC, costs stratified by cancer stage and treatment, and predictors of total net costs of care for EAC.\nMETHODS: A population-based retrospective cohort study was conducted using Ontario Cancer Registry-linked administrative health data from 2003 to 2011. The mean net costs of EAC care per 30 patient-days (2016 CAD) were estimated from the payer perspective using phase of care approach and generalized estimating equations. Predictors of net cost by phase of care were based on a generalized estimating equations model with a logarithmic link and gamma distribution adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical factors.\nRESULTS: The mean net costs of EAC care per 30 patient-days were $1016 (95% CI, $955-$1078) in the initial phase, $669 (95% CI, $594-$743) in the continuing care phase, and $8678 (95% CI, $8217-$9139) in the terminal phase. Overall, stage IV at diagnosis and surgery plus radiotherapy for EAC incurred the highest cost, particularly in the terminal phase. Strong predictors of higher net costs were receipt of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, surgery plus chemotherapy, radiotherapy alone, surgery alone, and chemotherapy alone in the initial and continuing care phases, stage III-IV disease and patients diagnosed with EAC later in a calendar year (2007-2011) in the initial and terminal phases, comorbidity in the continuing care phase, and older age at diagnosis (70-74 years), and geographic region in the terminal phase.\nCONCLUSIONS: Costs of care vary by phase of care, stage at diagnosis, and type of treatment for EAC. These cost estimates provide information to guide future resource allocation decisions, and clinical and policy interventions to reduce the burden of EAC.","author":[{"family":"Thein","given":"Hla-Hla"},{"family":"Jembere","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Thavorn","given":"Kednapa"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Kelvin K.

To obtain accurate classification results, training data sets are often created manually by humans which requires expert knowledge, time and money. Depending on the imbalance of the data set, this approach also either requires human labelling of all of the data or it fails to adequately recognize underrepresented categories. We propose an integration of web scraping, one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling as a multi-step classification rule that circumvents manual labelling. Unsupervised one-class document classification with the integration of out-of-domain training data is achieved and >80% of the target data is correctly classified. The proposed method thus even outperforms common machine learning classifiers and is validated on multiple data sets.","author":[{"family":"Thielmann","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Weisser","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Krenz","given":"Astrid"},{"family":"Säfken","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"thielmannUnsupervisedDocumentClassification2023","container-title":"Journal of Applied Statistics","container-title-short":"J Appl Stat","DOI":"10.1080/02664763.2021.1919063","ISSN":"0266-4763","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","page":"574-591","PMCID":"PMC9930816","PMID":"36819086","source":"PubMed","title":"Unsupervised document classification integrating web scraping, one-class SVM and LDA topic modelling","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},

Assessment of CTCs in peripheral blood from solid cancer patients has proven useful for detection of subclinical disease which otherwise remains invisible for current staging techniques. Based on results from large cohort studies in breast and colon cancer, diagnostic tests for enumeration of CTCs have been developed which can be used for tumor staging, prognosis, and post-treatment surveillance. Circulating plasma DNA derived from Epstein–Barr or human papilloma viruses has been established as a sensitive and highly specific biomarker for early cancer detection and disease monitoring.

Our study estimates phase-specific costs for esophageal cancer by age, year, histology, stage, and treatment for older patients in the United States and compares these costs within stage and treatment modalities.\nMETHODS: We identified 8061 esophageal cancer patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database for years 1998-2013. Total, cancer-attributable, and patient-liability costs were calculated based on separate phases of care-staging (or surgery), initial, continuing, and terminal. We estimated costs by treatment modality within stage and phase for esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma separately. We fit linear regression models using log transformation to determine cost by age and calendar year. All costs are reported in 2018 US dollars.\nRESULTS: Overall, mean (95% CI) monthly total cost estimates were high during the staging ($8953 [$8385-$9485]) and initial phases ($7731 [$7492-$7970]), decreased over the continuing phase ($2984 [$2814-$3154]), and increased substantially during the 6-month terminal phase ($18 150 [$17 211-$19 089]). This pattern of high staging and initial phase costs, decreasing continuing phase costs, and increasing terminal phase costs was seen in all stages. The highest staging costs were in stages III ($9249, $8025-$10 474) and II ($9171, $7642-$10 699). The highest initial phase cost was in stage IV, $9263 ($8758-49 768), the lowest continuing phase cost was in stage I, $2338 ($2160-$2517), and the highest terminal phase costs were in stages II ($20 533, $17 772-$23 293) and III ($20 599, $18 268-$22 929). The linear regression models showed that cancer-attributable costs remained stable over the study period and were unaffected by age for most histology, stage, and treatment modality subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our estimates demonstrate that esophageal cancer costs can vary widely by histology, stage, and treatment.

This review discusses some debates in the modern management of the disease. Endoscopic procedures for early cancer (T1a−b) are now embedded in routine care and the challenge will be to more accurately select patients for endoscopic resection with or without adjuvant therapy. Perioperative multimodal therapies are associated with improved survival compared to surgery alone for locally advanced esophageal cancer. However, there is no global consensus on the optimal regimen. Furthermore, histological subtype (adenocarcinomavs. squamous cell cancer) plays a role in the choice for treatment. New studies are underway to resolve some issues. The extent of the lymphadenectomy during esophagectomy remains controversial especially after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. The ideal operation balances between limiting surgical trauma and optimizing survival. Minimally invasive esophagectomy and enhanced recovery pathways are associated with decreased morbidity and faster recovery albeit there is no consensus yet what approach should be used. Finally, immune checkpoint inhibitors present promising preliminary results in the novel treatment of advanced or metastatic EC but their widespread application in clinical practice is still awaited.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Triantafyllou","given":"Tania"},{"family":"P L Wijnhoven","given":"Bas"},{"literal":"Department of Surgery, Hippocration General Hospital of Athens, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens 11527, Greece"},{"literal":"Department of Surgery, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam 3000, the Netherlands"}],"citation-key":"triantafyllouCurrentStatusEsophageal2020","container-title":"Chinese Journal of Cancer Research","DOI":"10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2020.03.01","ISSN":"1993-0631","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"271-286","source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Current status of esophageal cancer treatment","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://article.cjcrcn.org/en/article/doi/10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2020.03.01?viewType=HTML","volume":"32"},

Age-period-cohort modeling was used to estimate the period and cohort effects of ESCC and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). The Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to analyze the correlation between age-adjusted incidence rates of EC and the prevalence of risk factors from national surveys. The results showed the incidence rate of ESCC in men (AAPC = 4.2, 95% CI = 3.1−5.4, p < 0.001) increased prominently from 1985−1989 to 2015−2019 while that of EAC in men (AAPC = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.9−1.5, p < 0.001) and ESCC in women (AAPC = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.4−2.1, p < 0.001) increased to a lesser degree. Increased period effects were observed in ESCC in men, ESCC in women, and EAC in men. High correlations were found between the risk factors and the increased birth-cohort effects of ESCC (p < 0.05).

Coexisting conditions such as malnutrition and malaria may affect the feasibility, safety, and benefits of hydroxyurea in low-resource settings.\nMETHODS: We enrolled children 1 to 10 years of age with sickle cell anemia in four sub-Saharan countries. Children received hydroxyurea at a dose of 15 to 20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for 6 months, followed by dose escalation. The end points assessed feasibility (enrollment, retention, and adherence), safety (dose levels, toxic effects, and malaria), and benefits (laboratory variables, sickle cell-related events, transfusions, and survival).\nRESULTS: A total of 635 children were fully enrolled; 606 children completed screening and began receiving hydroxyurea at a mean (±SD) dose of 17.5±1.8 mg per kilogram per day. The retention rate was 94.2% at 3 years of treatment. Hydroxyurea therapy led to significant increases in both the hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin levels. Dose-limiting toxic events regarding laboratory variables occurred in 5.1% of the participants, which was below the protocol-specified threshold for safety. During the treatment phase, 20.6 dose-limiting toxic effects per 100 patient-years occurred, as compared with 20.7 events per 100 patient-years before treatment. As compared with the pretreatment period, the rates of clinical adverse events decreased with hydroxyurea use, including rates of vaso-occlusive pain (98.3 vs. 44.6 events per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.56), nonmalaria infection (142.5 vs. 90.0 events per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.72), malaria (46.9 vs. 22.9 events per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.66), transfusion (43.3 vs. 14.2 events per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.47), and death (3.6 vs. 1.1 deaths per 100 patient-years; incidence rate ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.88).\nCONCLUSIONS: Hydroxyurea treatment was feasible and safe in children with sickle cell anemia living in sub-Saharan Africa.

The very important strategy for the improvement of the antitumor effect against different cancers is synergistic combination of Cisplatin derivatives with: (1) anticancer agents—Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine, Cytarabine, Fludarabine, Pemetrexed, Ifosfamide, Irinotecan, Topotecan, Etoposide, Amrubicin, Doxorubicin, Epirubicin, Vinorelbine, Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, Nab-Paclitaxel; (2) modulators of resistant mechanisms; (3) signaling protein inhibitors—Erlotinib; Bortezomib; Everolimus; (4) and immunotherapeutic drugs—Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Bevacizumab, Cemiplimab, Cetuximab, Durvalumab, Erlotinib, Imatinib, Necitumumab, Nimotuzumab, Nivolumab, Onartuzumab, Panitumumab, Pembrolizumab, Rilotumumab, Trastuzumab, Tremelimumab, and Sintilimab. An important approach for overcoming the drug resistance and reduction of toxicity of Cisplatin derivatives is the application of nanocarriers (polymers and liposomes), which provide improved targeted delivery, increased intracellular penetration, selective accumulation in tumor tissue, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. The advantages of combination therapy are maximum removal of tumor cells in different phases; prevention of resistance; inhibition of the adaptation of tumor cells and their mutations; and reduction of toxicity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Tsvetkova","given":"Dobrina"},{"family":"Ivanova","given":"Stefka"}],"citation-key":"tsvetkovaApplicationApprovedCisplatin2022","container-title":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules27082466","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"8","page":"2466","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Application of Approved Cisplatin Derivatives in Combination Therapy against Different Cancer Diseases","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/8/2466","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"tuGlobalResearchTrends2022","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: Using visual bibliometric analysis, the application and development of artificial intelligence in clinical esophageal cancer are summarized, and the research progress, hotspots, and emerging trends of artificial intelligence are elucidated.\nMETHODS: On April 7th, 2022, articles and reviews regarding the application of AI in esophageal cancer, published between 2000 and 2022 were chosen from the Web of Science Core Collection. To conduct co-authorship, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis of countries, institutions, authors, references, and keywords in this field, VOSviewer (version 1.6.18), CiteSpace (version 5.8.R3), Microsoft Excel 2019, R 4.2, an online bibliometric platform (http://bibliometric.com/) and an online browser plugin (https://www.altmetric.com/) were used.\nRESULTS: A total of 918 papers were included, with 23,490 citations. 5,979 authors, 39,962 co-cited authors, and 42,992 co-cited papers were identified in the study. Most publications were from China (317). In terms of the H-index (45) and citations (9925), the United States topped the list. The journal \"New England Journal of Medicine\" of Medicine, General & Internal (IF = 91.25) published the most studies on this topic. The University of Amsterdam had the largest number of publications among all institutions. The past 22 years of research can be broadly divided into two periods. The 2000 to 2016 research period focused on the classification, identification and comparison of esophageal cancer. Recently (2017-2022), the application of artificial intelligence lies in endoscopy, diagnosis, and precision therapy, which have become the frontiers of this field. It is expected that closely esophageal cancer clinical measures based on big data analysis and related to precision will become the research hotspot in the future.\nCONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of scholars are devoted to artificial intelligence-related esophageal cancer research. The research field of artificial intelligence in esophageal cancer has entered a new stage. In the future, there is a need to continue to strengthen cooperation between countries and institutions. Improving the diagnostic accuracy of esophageal imaging, big data-based treatment and prognosis prediction through deep learning technology will be the continuing focus of research. The application of AI in esophageal cancer still has many challenges to overcome before it can be utilized.","author":[{"family":"Tu","given":"Jia-Xin"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Xue-Ting"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Hui-Qing"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Shan-Lan"},{"family":"Deng","given":"Li-Fang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Ruo-Ling"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xiao-Qiang"}],"citation-key":"tuGlobalResearchTrends2022","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2022.972357","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"eng","page":"972357","PMCID":"PMC9453500","PMID":"36091151","source":"PubMed","title":"Global research trends of artificial intelligence applied in esophageal carcinoma: A bibliometric analysis (2000-2022) via CiteSpace and VOSviewer","title-short":"Global research trends of artificial intelligence applied in esophageal carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"uozumiComplicationsEndoscopicResection2023","abstract":"Endoscopic resection (ER) is widely utilized as a minimally invasive treatment for upper gastrointestinal tumors; however, complications could occur during and after the procedure. Post-ER mucosal defect leads to delayed perforation and bleeding; therefore, endoscopic closure methods (endoscopic hand-suturing, the endoloop and endoclip closure method, and over-the-scope clip method) and tissue shielding methods (polyglycolic acid sheets and fibrin glue) are developed to prevent these complications. During duodenal ER, complete closure of the mucosal defect significantly reduces delayed bleeding and should be performed. An extensive mucosal defect that comprises three-quarters of the circumference in the esophagus, gastric antrum, or cardia is a significant risk factor for post-ER stricture. Steroid therapy is considered the first-line option for the prevention of esophageal stricture, but its efficacy for gastric stricture remains unclear. Methods for the prevention and management of ER-related complications in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum differ according to the organ; therefore, endoscopists should be familiar with ways of preventing and managing organ-specific complications.","author":[{"family":"Uozumi","given":"Takeshi"},{"family":"Abe","given":"Seiichiro"},{"family":"Makiguchi","given":"Mai Ego"},{"family":"Nonaka","given":"Satoru"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Haruhisa"},{"family":"Yoshinaga","given":"Shigetaka"},{"family":"Saito","given":"Yutaka"}],"citation-key":"uozumiComplicationsEndoscopicResection2023","container-title":"Clinical Endoscopy","container-title-short":"Clin Endosc","DOI":"10.5946/ce.2023.024","ISSN":"2234-2400","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"409-422","PMCID":"PMC10393571","PMID":"37430401","source":"PubMed","title":"Complications of endoscopic resection in the upper gastrointestinal tract","type":"article-journal","volume":"56"},

Currently, there are limited population-based data in the United States to guide these efforts.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using data from large commercial and Medicare Advantage health plans in the United States from 2004 - 2019. We identified individuals with BE and analyzed the proportion who developed EAC. EACs were classified as prevalent EAC (diagnosed within 30 days of index endoscopy), post-endoscopy esophageal adenocarcinoma (PEEC, diagnosed 30 - 365 days after index endoscopy), and incident EAC (diagnosed 365 days or more after index endoscopy). Using this cohort, we performed a nested case-control study to identify factors associated with prevalent EAC at BE diagnosis and study healthcare utilization prior to BE diagnosis.\nRESULTS: We identified 50,817 individuals with incident BE. Of the 366 who developed EAC, 67.2%, 13.7%, and 19.1% were diagnosed with prevalent EAC, PEEC, and incident EAC respectively. Factors positively associated with prevalent EAC versus BE without prevalent EAC included male sex, dysphagia, weight loss, and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score. In those with prevalent EAC, most patients with dysphagia or weight loss had their symptoms first recorded within three months of EAC diagnosis. Healthcare utilization rates were similar between those with and without prevalent EAC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Two-thirds of EACs among individuals with BE are diagnosed at the time of BE diagnosis. Additionally, PEEC accounts for 14% of these EACs. These results may guide future research studies that investigate novel BE diagnostic strategies that reduce the morbidity and mortality of EAC.","author":[{"family":"Vajravelu","given":"Ravy K."},{"family":"Kolb","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Thanawala","given":"Shivani U."},{"family":"Scott","given":"Frank I."},{"family":"Han","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Singal","given":"Amit G."},{"family":"Falk","given":"Gary W."},{"family":"Katzka","given":"David A."},{"family":"Wani","given":"Sachin"}],"citation-key":"vajraveluCharacterizationPrevalentPostEndoscopy2022","container-title":"Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology: The Official Clinical Practice Journal of the American Gastroenterological Association","container-title-short":"Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol","DOI":"10.1016/j.cgh.2021.02.005","ISSN":"1542-7714","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"1739-1747","PMCID":"PMC8895727","PMID":"33549872","source":"PubMed","title":"Characterization of Prevalent, Post-Endoscopy, and Incident Esophageal Cancer in the United States: A Large Retrospective Cohort Study","title-short":"Characterization of Prevalent, Post-Endoscopy, and Incident Esophageal Cancer in the United States","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"valkemaEffectivityTargetedTherapy2023","abstract":"Therapies that target specific tumor drivers or immune checkpoints are increasingly explored for esophageal cancer patients. This review addresses developments in therapies with targeted anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) agents and immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with stage IV esophageal cancer. First-line palliative treatment with the anti-HER2 agent trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has been approved for use in patients with HER2 positive gastro-esophageal adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy plus perioperative trastuzumab however has not demonstrated a survival benefit in advanced esophageal cancer patients eligible for surgery. Potentially better responses are expected with dual agent anti-HER2 therapy instead of monotherapy. In the metastatic setting, the antibody–drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan is effective after progression on trastuzumab. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab, antibodies blocking the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells, have recently gained approval for clinical use in esophageal cancer patients for specific indications. Synergistic effects might be achieved with combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors that target PD-1 on T cells or PD ligand 1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells and anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) receptor on T cells. Multiple clinical trials investigating combinations of targeted and immunotherapies, with or without (neo)adjuvant chemo(radio)therapy, for curative and palliative treatment, are underway, and are expected to deliver a long-awaited improvement in the prognosis of esophageal cancer patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Valkema","given":"M.

Omeprazole (40 mg/day) was given from the first APC application to one month after completion of the treatment, then given symptomatically. Twenty four hour pH-metry was performed during endotherapy.\nRESULTS: Complete re-epithelialisation was visualised at endoscopy in 25/31 patients (81%) after a mean number of 2.4 APC sessions (range 1-4). Only partial squamous re-epithelialisation was observed in three patients and three others had no eradication. At histological assessment, eradication of Barrett's oesophagus was only confirmed in 19/31 patients (61%) due to the presence of a few residual Barrett's glands under the new squamous epithelium. Complete eradication was related to a Barrett's oesophagus segment length of less than 4 cm and the absence of circumferential extension but not to the normalisation of oesophageal acid exposure under PPI therapy. Seventeen patients with apparently complete endoscopic and histological eradication of Barrett's oesophagus were re-evaluated at one year; eight (47%) disclosed relapsing islands of Barrett metaplasia despite continuous omeprazole therapy (10-40 mg/day).\nCONCLUSIONS: APC combined with 40 mg omeprazole daily can eradicate Barrett's mucosa with apparent squamous re-epithelialisation in the majority of patients even in the absence of normalisation of oesophageal acid exposure. However, one year after endotherapy for Barrett's oesophagus, relapse is frequent but limited in extent.","author":[{"family":"Van Laethem","given":"J.

Radiotherapy-free DA-EPOCH-R and R-CHOP plus radiotherapy (RT) have been the upfront standard regimens worldwide. However, performing DA-EPOCH-R in resource-constrained settings can be burdensome, especially in low/middle-income countries, where data on PMBCL are still largely unknown. We retrospectively analyzed 93 patients with PMBCL diagnosed between 2008 and 2018 with the intention of comparing the characteristics of the patients and the results obtained with each protocol and to verify if the use of less intensive chemotherapy is still possible to be used. The median age was 28 years, 59.1% were female, 42.3% were in advanced stages, and 92.1% were with bulky disease. DA-EPOCH-R (41.9%), R-CHOP (35.5%), and R-CHOEP (22.6%) were the regimens used, and no difference was observed in the characteristics of the patients. After four cycles of chemotherapy, complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and progressive disease (PD) rates were 40%, 55.7%, and 4.5%, respectively.

Estimated 5-year PFS and OS were 77.2% and 77.4%, respectively. Only LDH levels remained independently associated with PFS, and type of treatment was not associated with OS, PFS, or relapse rate.

  {"id":"vellayappanChemoradiotherapyChemoradiotherapySurgery2017","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Please see Appendix 4 for a glossary of terms.The outcome of patients with esophageal cancer is generally poor. Although multimodal therapy is standard, there is conflicting evidence regarding the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy.\nOBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness and safety of chemoradiotherapy plus surgery with that of chemoradiotherapy alone in people with nonmetastatic esophageal carcinoma.\nSEARCH METHODS: We performed a computerized search for relevant studies, up to Feburary 2017, on the CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase databases using MeSH headings and keywords. We searched five online databases of clinical trials, handsearched conference proceedings, and screened reference lists of retrieved papers.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing chemoradiotherapy plus esophagectomy with chemoradiotherapy alone for localized esophageal carcinoma. We excluded RCTs comparing chemotherapy or radiotherapy alone with esophagectomy.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, using standardized Cochrane methodological procedures. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), estimated with Hazard Ratio (HR). Secondary outcomes, estimated with risk ratio (RR), were local and distant progression-free survival (PFS), quality of life (QoL), treatment-related mortality and morbidity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia. Data were analyzed using a random effects model in Review Manager 5.3 software.\nMAIN RESULTS: From 2667 references, we identified two randomized studies, in six reports, that included 431 participants. All participants were clinically staged to have at least T3 and/or node positive thoracic esophageal carcinoma, 93% of which was squamous cell histology. The risk of methodological bias of the included studies was low to moderate.High-quality evidence found the addition of esophagectomy had little or no difference on overall survival (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.24; P = 0.92; I² = 0%; two trials). Neither study reported PFS, therefore, freedom from loco-regional relapse was used as a proxy. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that the addition of esophagectomy probably improved freedom from locoregional relapse (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.76; P = 0.0004; I² = 0%; two trials), but low-quality evidence suggested it may increase the risk of treatment-related mortality (RR 5.11, 95% CI 1.74 to 15.02; P = 0.003; I² = 2%; two trials).The other pre-specified outcomes (quality of life, treatment-related toxicity, and use of salvage procedures for dysphagia) were reported by only one study, which found very low-quality evidence that use of esophagectomy was associated with reduced short-term QoL (MD 0.93, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.62), and low-quality evidence that it reduced use of salvage procedures for dysphagia (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.75). Neither study compared treatment-related morbidity between treatment groups.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, the addition of esophagectomy to chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, provides little or no difference on overall survival, and may be associated with higher treatment-related mortality. The addition of esophagectomy probably delays locoregional relapse, however, this end point was not well defined in the included studies. It is undetermined whether these results can be applied to the treatment of adenocarcinomas, tumors involving the distal esophagus and gastro-esophageal junction, and to people with poor response to chemoradiation.","author":[{"family":"Vellayappan","given":"Balamurugan A."},{"family":"Soon","given":"Yu Yang"},{"family":"Ku","given":"Geoffrey Y."},{"family":"Leong","given":"Cheng Nang"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Jiade J."},{"family":"Tey","given":"Jeremy Cs"}],"citation-key":"vellayappanChemoradiotherapyChemoradiotherapySurgery2017","container-title":"The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews","container-title-short":"Cochrane Database Syst Rev","DOI":"10.1002/14651858.CD010511.pub2","ISSN":"1469-493X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",8,22]]},"language":"eng","page":"CD010511","PMCID":"PMC6483706","PMID":"28829911","source":"PubMed","title":"Chemoradiotherapy versus chemoradiotherapy plus surgery for esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"8"},

  {"id":"wachterAnaplasticThyroidCarcinoma2020","abstract":"PURPOSE: The prognosis of anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is poor. Despite various attempts to modify common treatment modalities, including surgery, external beam radiation (EBRT) and chemotherapy (CTX), no standardized treatment is yet established. This study aimed to analyze the changing trends of treatment concepts and associated overall survival (OS) over the last two decades.\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 42 patients with histologically confirmed ATC. The outcome measures included the evaluation of clinical characteristics and treatments performed with regard to OS.\nRESULTS: Median OS for all tumor stages was 6 (range 1 week-79) months, 6.5 months for stage IVA/B and 4 months for stage IVC carcinoma patients. Twenty-one patients with stage IVA/B carcinomas underwent curative treatment, including thyroidectomy with lymphadenectomy (TTX plus LAD, n = 11) or multimodal treatment with TTX plus LAD and EBRT plus/minus CTX (n = 10). The median OS of patients with stage IVA/B carcinomas was significantly prolonged after multimodal treatment than after surgery alone (25 vs. 3 months, p = 0.04). Fifteen of 18 patients with stage IVC carcinomas received palliative, 3 patients multimodal treatment. The median OS of stage IVC patients after trimodal therapy was not significantly longer than after debulking procedures (6 vs. 7 months, p = 0.25). In the time period 1999-2009, only 4 (21%) patients received multimodal treatment compared to 9 (39%) in the period from 2009 to 2019, but this did not result in a significantly prolonged survival in the latter period (8.5 vs. 15 months, p = 0.61).\nCONCLUSION: Concurrent radio- and/or chemotherapy in combination with surgery seems to result in improved survival in stage IVA/B ATC, whereas this is not the case in patients with stage IVC tumors. Novel treatment regimens are urgently needed to improve the dismal prognosis of ATC.","author":[{"family":"Wächter","given":"Sabine"},{"family":"Vorländer","given":"C."},{"family":"Schabram","given":"J."},{"family":"Mintziras","given":"I."},{"family":"Fülber","given":"I."},{"family":"Manoharan","given":"J."},{"family":"Holzer","given":"K."},{"family":"Bartsch","given":"D.

We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing surgery alone with combined chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery.\nMETHODS: Patients assigned to multimodal therapy received two courses of chemotherapy in weeks 1 and 6 (fluorouracil, 15 mg per kilogram of body weight daily for five days, and cisplatin, 75 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 7) and a course of radiotherapy (40 Gy, administered in 15 fractions over a three-week period, beginning concurrently with the first course of chemotherapy), followed by surgery. The patients assigned to surgery had no preoperative therapy.\nRESULTS: Of the 58 patients assigned to multimodal therapy and the 55 assigned to surgery, 10 and 1, respectively, were withdrawn for protocol violations. At the time of surgery, 23 of 55 patients (42 percent) treated with preoperative multimodal therapy who could be evaluated had positive nodes or metastases, as compared with 45 of the 55 patients (82 percent) who underwent surgery alone (P<0.001). Thirteen of the 52 patients (25 percent) who underwent surgery after multimodal therapy had complete responses as determined pathologically. The median survival of patients assigned to multimodal therapy was 16 months, as compared with 11 months for those assigned to surgery alone (P=0.01). At one, two, and three years, 52, 37, and 32 percent, respectively, of patients assigned to multimodal therapy were alive, as compared with 44, 26, and 6 percent of those assigned to surgery, with the survival advantage favoring multimodal therapy reaching significance at three years (P=0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Multimodal treatment is superior to surgery alone for patients with resectable adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.","author":[{"family":"Walsh","given":"T.

  {"id":"wangCompleteSurgicalResection2019","abstract":"Background: When achieved, complete surgical resection improves outcomes in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). However, most ATC patients present with advanced inoperable disease, often with impending airway obstruction, increased hemorrhage risk, and significant dysphagia. Novel treatment strategies are critically needed to improve disease control and decrease locoregional morbidity. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a neoadjuvant regimen by using dabrafenib with trametinib followed by surgical resection in patients with initially unresectable BRAFV600E-mutated ATC. Methods: Case series of six consecutive patients with BRAFV600E-mutated ATC diagnosed between January 2017 and February 2018. Pathologic confirmation of ATC was obtained before treatment. BRAFV600E status was ascertained via immunohistochemistry or sequencing of circulating tumor DNA. All patients received dabrafenib and trametinib (DT) followed by surgical resection and adjuvant chemoradiation. Three patients also received pembrolizumab. Results: Complete surgical resection was achieved in all patients. Histopathologic analyses of resected specimens showed high pathologic response rates with significantly decreased ATC viability and residual papillary thyroid carcinoma components. Overall survival at six months and one year was 100% and 83%, respectively. Locoregional control rate was 100%. Two patients died of distant metastases without evidence of locoregional disease at 8 and 14 months from diagnosis. The remaining four patients had no evidence of disease at the last follow-up. Conclusions: We report the first series in the literature of BRAFV600E-mutated ATC patients with locoregionally advanced disease treated with DT followed by surgical resection. We demonstrated feasibility of complete resection, decreased need for tracheostomy, high pathologic response rates, and durable locoregional control with symptom amelioration.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jennifer R."},{"family":"Zafereo","given":"Mark E."},{"family":"Dadu","given":"Ramona"},{"family":"Ferrarotto","given":"Renata"},{"family":"Busaidy","given":"Naifa L."},{"family":"Lu","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Ahmed","given":"Salmaan"},{"family":"Gule-Monroe","given":"Maria K."},{"family":"Williams","given":"Michelle D."},{"family":"Sturgis","given":"Erich M."},{"family":"Goepfert","given":"Ryan P."},{"family":"Gross","given":"Neil D."},{"family":"Lai","given":"Stephen Y."},{"family":"Gunn","given":"Gary Brandon"},{"family":"Phan","given":"Jack"},{"family":"Rosenthal","given":"David I."},{"family":"Fuller","given":"Clifton David"},{"family":"Morrison","given":"William H."},{"family":"Iyer","given":"Priyanka"},{"family":"Cabanillas","given":"Maria E."}],"citation-key":"wangCompleteSurgicalResection2019","container-title":"Thyroid: Official Journal of the American Thyroid Association","container-title-short":"Thyroid","DOI":"10.1089/thy.2019.0133","ISSN":"1557-9077","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"1036-1043","PMCID":"PMC6707029","PMID":"31319771","source":"PubMed","title":"Complete Surgical Resection Following Neoadjuvant Dabrafenib Plus Trametinib in BRAFV600E-Mutated Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"29"},

The main inclusion criteria were patients with locally advanced (cT2-4N0-3M0) ESCC who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) followed by MIE, and divided into two groups according to different neoadjuvant strategies. Propensity score matching was performed to improve the comparability between the two groups.\nRESULTS: After exclusion and matching, 141 patients were enrolled retrospectively: 92 received NCT, and 49 received NCRT. No difference in clinicopathologic characteristics or incidence of adverse events between groups. A shorter operation time (215.7 ± 35.5 min) (p < 0.001), less blood loss (111.2 ± 67.7 ml) (p = 0.0007) and a greater number of lymph nodes retrieved (33.8 ± 11.7) (p = 0.002) were observed in NCT group than in NCRT group.

Primary endpoint of safety index was rating of severity of adverse drug reactions (grades 1–5).\n\nResults\nThe ORR, PFS, and CR values of combined treatment with camrelizumab was better than alone treatment, camrelizumab alone was better than chemotherapy (RR = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.30–0.67; P < 0.001; RR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.25–2.13; P < 0.001; RR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52–1.02; P<0.001). When grade > 2, the incidence rate of combined treatment and chemotherapy are higher than monotherapy (RR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51–0.86; P<0.001). In any grade, the safety of camrelizumab combination therapy was better than that of monotherapy, the safety of chemotherapy was better than camrelizumab plus chemotherapy.\n\nConclusion\nIn terms of effectiveness, the combination of camrelizumab is better than monotherapy, and monotherapy is better than chemotherapy. In terms of safety, when the grade > 2, single use is better than combination therapy and chemotherapy. In any grade of adverse event, the safety of combined use of camrelizumab is better than that of single use, and the safety of chemotherapy is better than the combined use of camrelizumab plus chemotherapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiting"},{"family":"Su","given":"Song"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yaling"}],"citation-key":"wangEfficacySafetyCamrelizumab2021a","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","container-title-short":"Front Oncol","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2021.695512","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,25]]},"page":"695512","PMCID":"PMC8268013","PMID":"34249752","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Efficacy and Safety of Camrelizumab Monotherapy and Combination Therapy for Cancers: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","title-short":"Efficacy and Safety of Camrelizumab Monotherapy and Combination Therapy for Cancers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268013/","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"wangRecentAdvancesCombination2022","abstract":"Esophageal cancer has a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis, with more than one-third of patients receiving a diagnosis of locally advanced cancer. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the dominant histological subtype of esophageal cancer in Asia and Eastern Europe. Although neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has been the standard treatment for locally advanced ESCC, patient outcomes remain unsatisfactory, with recurrence rates as high as 30–50%. The combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and CRT has emerged as a novel strategy to treat esophageal cancer, and it may have a synergistic action and provide greater efficacy. In the phase III CheckMate-577 trial, one year of adjuvant nivolumab after neoadjuvant CRT improved disease-free survival in patients with residual disease on pathology. Moreover, several phase I and II studies have shown that ICIs combined with concurrent CRT may increase the rate of pathologic complete response for resectable ESCC, but they lack long-term follow-up results. In unresectable cases, the combination of camrelizumab and definitive CRT showed promising results against ESCC in a phase Ib trial. Phase III randomized trials are currently ongoing to investigate the survival benefits of ICIs combined with neoadjuvant or definitive CRT, and they will clarify the role of immunotherapy in locally advanced ESCC. Additionally, valid biomarkers to predict tumor response and survival outcomes need to be further explored.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ruixi"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shiliang"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Baoqing"},{"family":"Xi","given":"Mian"}],"citation-key":"wangRecentAdvancesCombination2022","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers14205168","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"20","page":"5168","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Recent Advances in Combination of Immunotherapy and Chemoradiotherapy for Locally Advanced Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/20/5168","volume":"14"},
  {"id":"wangRemodelingTumorMicroenvironment2022","abstract":"Tumor cells manipulate the local environment in which they grow, creating a tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes tumor survival and metastasis. The TME is an extremely complex environment rich in immunosuppressive cells and cytokines. Various methods to therapeutically target the complicated TME are emerging as a potential approach for cancer treatment. Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are one of the most promising methods for remodeling the TME into an antitumor environment and can be used alone or in combination with other immunotherapy options. OVs replicate specifically in tumor cells and can be genetically engineered to target multiple elements of the TME simultaneously, thus representing a therapeutic with the potential to modify the TME to promote activation of antitumor immune cells and overcome tumor therapeutic resistance and recurrence. In this review, we analyze the tropism of OVs towards tumor cells and explore the interaction between OVs and immune cells, tumor stroma, vasculature and the metabolic environment in detail to help understand how OVs may be one of our most promising prospects for long-term curative therapies. We also discuss some of the challenges associated with TME therapies, and future perspectives in this evolving field.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Lihong"},{"family":"Chard Dunmall","given":"Louisa S."},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Zhenguo"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yaohe"}],"citation-key":"wangRemodelingTumorMicroenvironment2022","container-title":"Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer","container-title-short":"J Immunother Cancer","DOI":"10.1136/jitc-2021-004167","ISSN":"2051-1426","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5]]},"language":"eng","page":"e004167","PMCID":"PMC9157365","PMID":"35640930","source":"PubMed","title":"Remodeling the tumor microenvironment by oncolytic viruses: beyond oncolysis of tumor cells for cancer treatment","title-short":"Remodeling the tumor microenvironment by oncolytic viruses","type":"article-journal","volume":"10"},
  {"id":"wangRiskStratificationPatients2022","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Thyroid carcinoma is the only cancer that regards age as an important predictor of thyroid cancer-specific survival (CSS). While the 8th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system raised the age cutoff from 45 to 55 years for differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) to more accurately predict the prognosis, there is no new information regarding the role of age in the prognosis of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC). The aim of this study was to determine the optimal age cutoff values for mortality risk stratification in ATC patients. Furthermore, a nomogram to predict ATC CSS was developed in each age group.\nMETHODS: Patients diagnosed with ATC between 2004 and 2015 were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1140 patients were enrolled as cohort 1 to describe the characteristics of ATC, while a total of 556 patients were included as cohort 2 to determine age cutoff values for risk stratification by X-tile program. Training set and testing set were randomly generated to develop and validate a predictive nomogram of CSS in each age group.\nRESULTS: The 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year survival was 27.6%, 15.1%, and 6.2%, respectively, in cohort 1. X-tile program results showed that the optimal age cutoff values for mortality risk stratification were 65 and 85 years old (p < 0.001). Distant metastasis was independently associated with CSS in patients younger than 85 years old, and these patients benefited more from complete resection of the tumor and radiotherapy/chemotherapy. However, no predictors of CSS were identified in patients over 85 years old, and interventions (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) targeting ATC had little role in disease control in these patients. The nomogram was developed and validated based on the independent CSS predictors in each age group. The C-index values of the training set and testing set were 0.735 [95% CI, 0.696-0.774] and 0.733 [95% CI, 0.663-0.804] for CSS in patients of ≤64 years old, while the values were 0.767 [95% CI, 0.730-0.804] and 0.783 [95% CI, 0.718-0.848] in patients of 65-84 years old. All of the C-index values were larger than 0.7, which showed acceptable prediction performance of the nomograms.\nCONCLUSIONS: Age can be used as an auxiliary stratification factor of prognosis in ATC patients. The survival may be improved in patients younger than 85 years old if combination therapy (surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) was indicated and applicable, while no optimal therapeutic strategy was determined in patients older than 85 years old. The established nomograms can provide good prediction of CSS according to age group.","author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Mingjun"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Gong","given":"Rixiang"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Jingqiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Zhihui"}],"citation-key":"wangRiskStratificationPatients2022","container-title":"Endocrine","container-title-short":"Endocrine","DOI":"10.1007/s12020-022-03085-w","ISSN":"1559-0100","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8]]},"language":"eng","page":"305-318","PMID":"35608773","source":"PubMed","title":"Risk stratification in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: role of age","title-short":"Risk stratification in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"77"},

This review will summarize the epidemiology, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Recent Findings Novel approaches to screening may be cost-effective in regions with a high incidence of ESCC. Multi-disciplinary evaluation and treatment has become the standard of care. Endoscopic resection may be an option for early stage ESCC. Minimally invasive esophagectomy can be performed safely as a primary therapy or after-induction chemoradiation. Several recent studies have found a survival benefit to immunotherapy for patients with metastatic or persistent disease.

  {"id":"wrightUpdateCancerChemotherapy1986a","abstract":"This article updating cancer chemotherapy of gastrointestinal cancer completes the fivepart series begun in the April issue of the Journal. Treatment of cancer of the small intestine, the gallbladder and bile duct, primary cancer of the liver, and the esophagus are reviewed in this concluding article., Treatment of choice of cancer of the small intestine is surgical resection. Small bowel cancer is less responsive than gastric cancer to chemotherapy. While chemotherapy may produce temporary partial remissions in patients with gallbladder and bile duct cancer, there is no evidence that it produces longterm survival time. In primary liver cancer, surgery is the only curative treatment, but only 30 percent of patients are diagnosed with resectable lesions, and the surgical mortality rate is high. The most active single agents appear to be doxorubicin, fluorouracil, and neocarcinostatin. Data on combination chemotherapy are limited., With carcinoma of the esophagus, 95 percent of patients die of the condition. The standard treatment for locoregional disease is surgical resection and/or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy has been slow to develop; single-agent chemotherapy has been reported to be active in 15 percent of cases with durations of 2 to 5 months. Combination chemotherapy is so recent that data are incomplete as to long-term results of disease-free and total survival times, but polychemotherapy appears to be more effective than single agents., With earlier detection, prompt surgery, earlier chemotherapy, improved dose scheduling, and further exploration of combination therapy, better overall results with a major impact years later may be expected.

The pooled HR for overall survival (OS) was calculated using a random-effects model. The pooled results demonstrated that for all patients with resectable ATC, the combination of surgery and radiotherapy significantly reduced the risk of death compared with surgery alone (HR =0.51, 95% CI: 0.36-0.73, Z=3.66, P=0.0002). To investigate the prognostic impacts of chemotherapy in patients with ATC, we also calculated the pooled HR of chemotherapy for OS using a random-effects model; however, the pooled results suggested that chemotherapy did not prolong the survival of ATC patients compared with controls (HR =0.63, 95% CI: 0.33-1.21, Z=1.39, P=0.17).\nCONCLUSION: This study provided evidence that currently, for patients with ATC, postoperative radiotherapy may prolong survival; in contrast, chemotherapy did not improve long-term survival.","author":[{"family":"Xia","given":"Quansong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xue"},{"family":"Zhong","given":"Zhaoming"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Chuanzheng"}],"citation-key":"xiaEvidenceUpdatedMetaanalysis2018","container-title":"OncoTargets and Therapy","container-title-short":"Onco Targets Ther","DOI":"10.2147/OTT.S153759","ISSN":"1178-6930","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"eng","page":"2251-2257","PMCID":"PMC5914740","PMID":"29719407","source":"PubMed","title":"Evidence from an updated meta-analysis of the prognostic impacts of postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy in patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"11"},
  {"id":"xiangRelook8thEdition2021","abstract":"OBJECTIVE: In the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system (TNM-8), changes have been made regarding anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) compared with the 7th edition (TNM-7). The major changes are that anaplastic ATC now has the same T stage definitions as differentiated thyroid cancer, and new staging of IVA and IVB is implemented. However, the clinical impact of the new edition for ATC remains unclear due to scarce and conflicting data. In this study, we compared the AJCC TNM-7 and TNM-8 in the same group of patients.\nDESIGN: In this retrospective study, we included patients who were diagnosed with ATC between 2004 and 2015; data were gathered from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database.\nMETHODS: Overall survival (OS) was evaluated according to T stage and TNM stage according to the 7th and 8th editions. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank testing was used to analyse OS. The effect of potential predictors was estimated using the Cox regression model.\nRESULTS: We included 669 patients in the study. The median age of the cohort was 70 years. During the follow-up, 600 (89.7%) patients died, 528 of whom died of thyroid cancer. The TNM-8 T staging more effectively predicted survival than the 7th edition (proportion of variation explained: 3.53% vs. 1.72%). However, the clinical stage was almost unchanged according to the TNM-8 (proportion of variation explained: 10.69% vs. 10.73%).\nCONCLUSIONS: The new T classification is an effective predictor of survival for patients with ATC. The results support the use of T definitions as per those of differentiated thyroid cancer. However, whether lymph node metastasis should be taken into account for defining ATC TNM staging should be reconsidered.","author":[{"family":"Xiang","given":"Jingzhe"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zhihong"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hao"}],"citation-key":"xiangRelook8thEdition2021","container-title":"Clinical Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)","DOI":"10.1111/cen.14371","ISSN":"1365-2265","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",4]]},"language":"eng","page":"700-710","PMID":"33368530","source":"PubMed","title":"A relook at the 8th edition of the AJCC TNM staging system of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: A SEER-based study","title-short":"A relook at the 8th edition of the AJCC TNM staging system of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"94"},
  {"id":"xuAdvancesThyroidPathology2023","abstract":"In the upcoming World Health Organization fifth edition classification of endocrine tumors, there were several major changes related to high grade follicular-derived thyroid carcinoma (HGFCTC) and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) based on emerging evidence about the diagnostic criteria clinical behavior, prognostic factors, and molecular signatures of these tumors. In this review, we aim to summarize the major evolutions of HGFCTC and ATC. HGFCTC is a nonanaplastic carcinoma with high grade features (High mitotic count, tumor necrosis). It is subdivided into poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma diagnosed using the Turin proposal and differentiated high grade thyroid carcinoma. The latter is defined by the presence of the cytoarchitectutal features of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (eg, papillae) but harbors elevated mitotic activity and/or tumor necrosis. Poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma is predominantly RAS -driven and associated with RAI avidity and high propensity for distant metastasis, whereas differentiated high grade thyroid carcinoma is mostly BRAFV600E -driven. ATC may show a wide range of histologic features. Carcinoma of pure squamous phenotype is associated with a high frequency of BRAF V600E mutations and is now considered as a subtype of ATC. There is a stepwise molecular progression from well-differentiated carcinoma to HGFCTC to ATC manifested by 1) early and persistent driver alteration in the MAPK pathway, particularly BRAF V600E and RAS mutations, and 2) gain of secondary aggressive molecular signatures (such as TERT promoter and TP53 mutations) when tumors progress from well-differentiated to high grade to anaplastic carcinoma.","author":[{"family":"Xu","given":"Bin"},{"family":"Ghossein","given":"Ronald A."}],"citation-key":"xuAdvancesThyroidPathology2023","container-title":"Advances in Anatomic Pathology","container-title-short":"Adv Anat Pathol","DOI":"10.1097/PAP.0000000000000380","ISSN":"1533-4031","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",1,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"3-10","PMID":"36306188","source":"PubMed","title":"Advances in Thyroid Pathology: High Grade Follicular Cell-derived Thyroid Carcinoma and Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma","title-short":"Advances in Thyroid Pathology","type":"article-journal","volume":"30"},

Endoscopic submucosal dissection techniques using the diathermic needle knife or the insulated-tip diathermic knife have been introduced to overcome this disadvantage, but they have high risks for bleeding and perforation. Therefore, we have developed a new endoscopic submucosal dissection technique using the tip of an electrosurgical snare (thin type) and assessed its efficacy. Methods: Fifty-nine lesions with differentiated-type gastric cancer without ulceration were treated with our technique at the University Hospital. The tip of an electrosurgical snare (thin type) was used for mucosal incision and submucosal dissection as a flexible diathermic knife. Results: The size of tumor was 5–85 mm in diameter (mean size: 29 mm) and the location varied from cardia to antrum. Among 59 lesions, 56 lesions (56/59, 95%) were resected completely in an en-bloc fashion with much less perforation (2/59, 3.4%) and bleeding (1/59, 1.7%) regardless of their size and location.

  {"id":"yamamotoEndoscopicSubmucosalDissection2005","abstract":"For a reliable en bloc resection of large superficial lesions, we have been performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) using sodium hyaluronate and other assisting devices. The ESD using sodium hyaluronate uses the long-lasting mucosal protrusion for safety and ease of mucosal and submucosal incision with a needle knife. This enables en bloc resections of large superficial tumors without resorting to a snaring method. A transparent hood attached to the endoscope tip is used to safely assist precise control of a needle-knife tip while incising the mucosa. A small-caliber tip transparent hood (ST hood) is used to open the incised mucosa for better visualization of the submucosal tissue. Combined with the long-lasting submucosal thickening by locally injected sodium hyaluronate, an ST hood enables safe dissection of the submucosal layer with a needle knife. Effective control of bleeding during the procedure is also a key element for success. Argon plasma coagulation and/or a hemostatic forceps can be used to control bleeding during the procedure. Perforation is a major concern as a possible complication of ESD. It can be prevented by sufficiently thickening the submucosa by proper injection of sodium hyaluronate and careful selection of the incising layer. By using ESD with sodium hyaluronate and an ST hood, it is feasible to treat endoscopically large superficial tumors in the stomach, esophagus, and colon, which used to require surgical treatments.","author":[{"family":"Yamamoto","given":"Hironori"}],"citation-key":"yamamotoEndoscopicSubmucosalDissection2005","container-title":"Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology: The Official Clinical Practice Journal of the American Gastroenterological Association","container-title-short":"Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol","DOI":"10.1016/s1542-3565(05)00254-5","ISSN":"1542-3565","issue":"7 Suppl 1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",7]]},"language":"eng","page":"S74-76","PMID":"16013004","source":"PubMed","title":"Endoscopic submucosal dissection of early cancers and large flat adenomas","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

However, there are some demerits in this regimen because CDDP administration requires a large transfusion volume and 5-FU must be continuously infused over 24 h. Therefore, hospitalization is unavoidable. We collected retrospectively the data of definitive CRT with nedaplatin and S-1 as carried out in our institution.\nMETHODS: Patients with early and advanced esophageal cancer and relapsed esophageal cancer after radical surgery were included. Nedaplatin 80 mg/m(2) was given on days 1 and 29, and S-1 80 mg/m(2) on days 1-14 and 29-42. No prophylactic treatment with granulocyte colony stimulating factor was administered. Patients received two courses of concurrent radiotherapy of more than 50 Gy with or without two additional courses as adjuvant therapy every 4 weeks.\nRESULTS: Between August 2011 and June 2015, 89 patients (age range, 44-86 years; K-PS 90-100, 81 %; squamous cell carcinoma histology, 97 %; definitive/salvage CRT, 75/25 %) were collected. Twenty-one (24 %) patients completed four cycles, and 94 % received two or more cycles. Grade 4 leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 12, 7, and 10 % of the patients, respectively. Five patients developed febrile neutropenia. Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity included infection in 12 %, mucositis/esophagitis in 3 %, kidney in 3 %, and fatigue in 3 %. Sixty-four patients (72 %) received the prescribed full dose and full cycles of chemotherapy. A complete response was achieved in 76 patients (85 %). The 3-year overall survival rate was 54.4 % in definitive CRT and 39.8 % in salvage CRT, respectively.

  {"id":"yangAdvancesTargetedTherapy2020","abstract":"Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the most lethal cancers in the world, and its morbidity and mortality rates rank among the top ten in China. Currently, surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the primary clinical treatments for esophageal cancer. However, outcomes are still unsatisfactory due to the limited efficacy and severe adverse effects of conventional treatments. As a new type of approach, targeted therapies have been confirmed to play an important role in the treatment of esophageal cancer; these include cetuximab and bevacizumab, which target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), respectively. In addition, other drugs targeting surface antigens and signaling pathways or acting on immune checkpoints have been continuously developed. For example, trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a first-line treatment of HER-2-positive cancer. Moreover, the PD-L1 inhibitor pembrolizumab has been approved as a highly efficient drug for patients with PD-L1-positive or advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). These novel drugs can be used alone or in combination with other treatment strategies to further improve the treatment efficacy and prognosis of cancer patients. Nevertheless, adverse events, optimal dosages and effective combinations still need further investigation.

By December 31, 2019, 224 deaths had occurred. The median follow-up was 53.5 months (interquartile range, 18.2-87.4 months). Patients receiving NCRT plus surgery had prolonged overall survival compared with those receiving surgery alone (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.97; P = .03), with a 5-year survival rate of 59.9% (95% CI, 52.9%-66.1%) vs 49.1% (95% CI, 42.3%-55.6%), respectively.

  {"id":"yangResearchEsophagealCancer2021","abstract":"The most common form of esophageal cancer (EC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is prevalent in many unindustrialized societies, among people with lower socioeconomic status and those who frequently use tobacco and alcohol. In some areas, ESCC mortality ranked top among all cancer. In this review, we begin with discussions of the extensive research on EC in Linxian in northern China that started 60 years ago and the recent studies in Kenya from our personal perspectives. Based on the results obtained from these studies and information from the literature, we summarize our current understanding about the risk factors for ESCC including lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, consumption of food and beverages at high temperature and other unhealthy habits), poor diet and nutritional insufficiencies and genetic susceptibility. Elimination or minimization of these environmental risk factors, as well as early detection and treatment of precancerous lesions, would be effective means for the prevention of ESCC. Current knowledge of molecular alterations in ESCC (gene mutations, hypermethylation and amplification or overexpression), as well as treatment of ESCC and the potential of targeted therapy, are also discussed. Finally, we propose effective approaches for the prevention of ESCC by adapting a healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet that would also prevent other diseases. Community outreach, public education and international collaboration are important for achieving this public health goal.","author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Chung S."},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiaoxin Luke"}],"citation-key":"yangResearchEsophagealCancer2021","container-title":"International Journal of Cancer","container-title-short":"Int J Cancer","DOI":"10.1002/ijc.33421","ISSN":"1097-0215","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,15]]},"language":"eng","page":"264-276","PMCID":"PMC8141013","PMID":"33270917","source":"PubMed","title":"Research on esophageal cancer: With personal perspectives from studies in China and Kenya","title-short":"Research on esophageal cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"149"},

We assessed the relationship between oral health and UGI cancers using a large prospective study of over 50,000 adults living in Golestan Province, Iran, a high-incidence area for these cancers. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for the association between three different measures of oral health [frequency of tooth brushing; number of missing teeth; and the sum of decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT)] and UGI cancers. During a median follow-up duration of 13 years, there were 794 incident UGI cancers (396 esophageal and 398 gastric cancers). Daily tooth brushing was associated with a decreased risk of developing both esophageal (HR = 0.670; 95% CI: 0.486-0.924) and gastric (HR = 0.741; 95% CI: 0.544-1.01) cancers (combined UGI cancer HR = 0.697; 95% CI: 0.558-0.871) compared with never brushing. Tooth loss in excess of the loess smoothed, age- and sex-specific median number of teeth lost was significantly associated with esophageal (HR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.08-2.47) and gastric cancers (HR = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.05-2.38). There were some adverse associations between DMFT and UGI cancers but most were not statistically significant. These results suggest increased risk of developing UGI cancers among individuals with poor oral health, and those who do not perform regular oral hygiene.

Patients with locally advanced EC benefit from multimodal therapy concepts including neoadjuvant chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and perioperative chemotherapy. Currently, immunotherapy for the solid tumor is a hot spot. Treatment with adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is the first immunotherapy for resectable EC listed in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines for the Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers. Recent clinical trials have established ICIs for three treatment models of resectable EC. Their short-term results demonstrated ideal efficacy and tolerable toxicity, though some concerns remain. This review summarizes the novel data on the ICIs for resectable EC and lists the registered related clinical trials.

  {"id":"yaoReActSynergizingReasoning2023","abstract":"While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across tasks in language understanding and interactive decision making, their abilities for reasoning (e.g. chain-of-thought prompting) and acting (e.g. action plan generation) have primarily been studied as separate topics. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs to generate both reasoning traces and task-specific actions in an interleaved manner, allowing for greater synergy between the two: reasoning traces help the model induce, track, and update action plans as well as handle exceptions, while actions allow it to interface with external sources, such as knowledge bases or environments, to gather additional information. We apply our approach, named ReAct, to a diverse set of language and decision making tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines, as well as improved human interpretability and trustworthiness over methods without reasoning or acting components. Concretely, on question answering (HotpotQA) and fact verification (Fever), ReAct overcomes issues of hallucination and error propagation prevalent in chain-of-thought reasoning by interacting with a simple Wikipedia API, and generates human-like task-solving trajectories that are more interpretable than baselines without reasoning traces. On two interactive decision making benchmarks (ALFWorld and WebShop), ReAct outperforms imitation and reinforcement learning methods by an absolute success rate of 34% and 10% respectively, while being prompted with only one or two in-context examples.

Different laser wavelengths have distinct features and applications based on their tissue absorption coefficient. Lasers with shorter wavelengths are effectively absorbed by hemoglobin, resulting in a good coagulation effect. Near-infrared lasers have ability to ablate solid tumors, while far-infrared lasers can make precise mucosal incisions without causing peripheral thermal damage.

However, we have observed cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with features of PMBL but without detectable mediastinal involvement. The goal was to assess our previously established gene expression profiling (GEP) signature for PMBL in classifying these cases. In a large series of DLBCL cases, we identified 24 cases with a GEP signature of PMBL, including 9 cases with a submission diagnosis of DLBCL consistent with PMBL (G-PMBL-P) and 15 cases with a submission diagnosis of DLBCL. The pathology reviewers agreed with the diagnosis in the 9 G-PMBL-P cases. Among the other 15 DLBCL cases, 11 were considered to be PMBL or DLBCL consistent with PMBL, 3 were considered to be DLBCL, and 1 case was a gray-zone lymphoma with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All 9 G-PMBL-P and 9 of the 15 DLBCL cases (G-PMBL-M) had demonstrated mediastinal involvement at presentation. Interestingly, 6 of the 15 DLBCL cases (G-PMBL-NM) had no clinical or radiologic evidence of mediastinal involvement. The 3 subgroups of PMBL had otherwise similar clinical characteristics, and there were no significant differences in overall survival. Genetic alterations of CIITA and PDL1/2 were detected in 26% and 40% of cases, respectively, including 1 G-PMBL-NM case with gain of PDL1/2.

We conducted a comprehensive literature search for ATC-targeted drug studies and compiled a summary of their efficacy and adverse effects (AEs) to provide new insights. Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of dabrafenib in combination with trametinib for the treatment of ATC, but vemurafenib and NTRK inhibitors showed limited clinical responses. We found that the previously valued therapeutic effect of lenvatinib may be unsatisfactory; combining tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitors (TKIs) with other agents results in a higher rate of clinical benefit. In addition, specific medications, including RET inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and Combretastatin A4-phosphate (CA4P), offer tremendous therapeutic potential. The AEs reported for all agents are relatively numerous but largely manageable clinically. More clinical trials are expected to further confirm the effectiveness and safety of these targeted drugs for ATC.","author":[{"family":"Yuan","given":"Jiaqian"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"yuanTargetedTherapyAnaplastic2022","container-title":"Cancers","container-title-short":"Cancers (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/cancers15010179","ISSN":"2072-6694","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,28]]},"language":"eng","page":"179","PMCID":"PMC9818071","PMID":"36612173","source":"PubMed","title":"Targeted Therapy for Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma: Advances and Management","title-short":"Targeted Therapy for Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma","type":"article-journal","volume":"15"},

Clinically, they are characterized by rapidly increasing anterior mediastinal masses, which can cause compression of the surrounding tissues. The diagnosis of PMBCL mainly depends on the pathological features, imaging examination and clinical features. Currently, the most commonly used therapeutic regimens are R‐CHOP and R‐EPOCH. Radiotherapy is beneficial in some patients, but it can also lead to long‐term toxicity. The research and development of novel therapies are ongoing, and some studies have achieved encouraging results, including those conducted on chimeric antigen receptor‐modified T (CAR‐T) cell therapy and anti‐PD‐1 drugs. However, randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are still needed. Positron emission tomography‐computed tomography (PET‐CT) is mainly used to assess the curative effect after treatment and to guide the subsequent treatment strategy., Management of PMBCL.

Our study aimed to evaluate the predictive ability of AJCC-v8 for survival in patients with ATC by exploring the association between lymph node stage and prognosis of ATC patients.\nMETHODS: Retrospective study of ATC in Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The association between LNM and survival of ATC was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. The predictive performances of the AJCC-v8 and AJCC-v7 were estimated through C-index, Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC).\nRESULTS: A total of 313 patients with ATC were included in our analysis. Notably, LNM was identified as an independent risk factor for ATC mortality (adjusted HR, 1.47, 95% CI, 1.10-1.96; p = .009), while the risk of mortality in N1a group was comparable to that in N1b group according to univariate (HR, 1.30, 95% CI, 0.92-1.82; p = .133) and multivariate (adjusted HR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.60-1.27; p = .467) cox analyses. Applying the AJCC-v8, the survival of migration population staged T1-3aN1M0 was significantly worse than that of T1-3aN0M0 patients (IVA stage), while was not different from that of T3b-T4bN0/N1M0 patients (IVB stage). With a higher C-index (0.60 vs. 0.59), lower AIC (2728 vs. 2732) and BIC (2732 vs. 2735), AJCC-v8 was demonstrably a more favourable prediction model than AJCC-v7.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that LNM was independently associated with poor prognosis of ATC, and AJCC-v8 with the modified staging of patients with LNM showed better survival predictive performance in ATC patients than AJCC-v7.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Hanpu"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yan-Ci"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Qi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lijun"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Shengrong"}],"citation-key":"zhangPrognosticValueLymph2021","container-title":"Clinical Endocrinology","container-title-short":"Clin Endocrinol (Oxf)","DOI":"10.1111/cen.14482","ISSN":"1365-2265","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"498-507","PMCID":"PMC8453880","PMID":"33864292","source":"PubMed","title":"The prognostic value of lymph node metastasis and the eighth edition of AJCC for patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer","type":"article-journal","volume":"95"},

The structure of tislelizumab has been modified to maximally inhibit the binding of PD-1 to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and minimize the binding of tislelizumab to Fcγ receptors. In clinical studies, tislelizumab has shown preliminary anti-tumor effects in various solid tumors, such as Hodgkin’s lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma, lung cancer, gastric and esophageal cancer, liver cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient tumors. In addition, it also showed new promise in solid tumor treatment in combination with ociperlimab. Due to its satisfactory anti-tumor effects, tislelizumab has received approvals in China for the treatment of classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous non-small cell lung cancer, non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and it is now under investigation for a new indication in microsatellite instability-high/mismatch repair-deficient tumors. Moreover, it has been granted orphan designations in hepatocellular carcinoma, esophageal cancer, and gastric cancer, including cancer of the gastroesophageal junction, by the US Food and Drug Administration. Tislelizumab has an acceptable safety profile; the most common adverse effects include fatigue, anemia, and decreased neutrophil count, while the most fatal events have been related to respiratory infection or failure, and hepatic injury. Tislelizumab has an economic advantage compared with other well-studied PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors; thus, the introduction of it could provide clinical oncologists with an effective weapon against tumors and may alleviate the burden of cancer patients.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Zhihua"},{"family":"Hao","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Geng","given":"Qing"}],"citation-key":"zhangTislelizumabModifiedAntitumor2022","container-title":"Cancer Control : Journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center","container-title-short":"Cancer Control","DOI":"10.1177/10732748221111296","ISSN":"1073-2748","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,4]]},"page":"10732748221111296","PMCID":"PMC9358212","PMID":"35926155","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Tislelizumab: A Modified Anti-tumor Programmed Death Receptor 1 Antibody","title-short":"Tislelizumab","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9358212/","volume":"29"},

  {"id":"zuccaObservationVsRadiotherapy2023","abstract":"LBA7505\n\nBackground: Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) has a good prognosis if remission is rapidly achieved with dose‐intensive immunochemotherapy. In these patients mediastinal radiotherapy (RT) may consolidate responses; however, it increases the risk of second malignancies and coronary or valvular heart disease. The IELSG37 trial was planned with a non-inferiority design to test whether RT can be omitted in patients who achieve a complete metabolic response (CMR) after immunochemotherapy. Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed PMBCL were eligible. Initial rituximab and anthracycline-based therapy was chosen according to local practice. CMR was defined, upon central review of positron emission computed tomography (PET/CT) scans, as Deauville score 1 to 3, according to the Lugano classification. Responding patients were randomized to observation (OBS) or consolidation RT (30 Gy). Randomization was stratified on gender, chemotherapy regimen, country, and PET/CT score. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) after randomization. The sample size (540 patients to enrol, and 376 to randomize) was calculated assuming a 30-month PFS probability of 0.85 in both arms, with alpha at 0.05, 80% power and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.77 as non-inferiority margin. Results: At a median follow-up of 30 months, the number of observed events was considerably lower than expected, hence, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) of the trial recommended to complete the planned total accrual without increasing the study size or duration. The primary endpoint analysis was performed, according to the IDMC recommendation, with ≥80% of patients having a minimum follow-up of 30 months. 545 patients (209 men, 336 women) were enrolled. Induction immunochemotherapy was completed and response assessed in 530 patients, 268 of them (50.6%) achieved a CMR and were randomly allocated to OBS (n = 132) or RT (n = 136). The PFS at 30 months was 98.5% (95%CI, 94.3 – 99.6) in the RT arm and 96.2% (95%CI, 91.1-98.4) in the OBS arm (P = 0.278). The estimated relative effect of radiotherapy vs observation in terms of hazard ratio (HR) was 0.47 (0.12-1.89) without adjustments and 0.79 (0.19-3.31) after stratification for the variables used for randomization. At 30 months the absolute risk reduction from RT was 2.3% (-1.5 to 6.2) unadjusted, and 0.8% (-3.0 to 8.3) with stratified HR. The number needed to treat is high (43 patients, unadjusted, and 126 after stratification). The 5-year overall survival was 99% in both arms. Longer follow-up is needed to examine late toxicity. Conclusions: This study is the largest prospective study of PMBCL ever conducted and although the event rate did not reach the assumed level, its evidence supports the omission of RT in patients achieving a CMR after immunochemotherapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",12,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Zucca","given":"Emanuele"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Kryachok","given":"Irina"},{"family":"Ciccone","given":"Giovannino"},{"family":"Ceriani","given":"Luca"},{"family":"Botto","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Mikhaeel","given":"N.

  {"id":"zwaenepoelCD70PDL1Anaplastic2017","abstract":"AIMS: During recent years, immune checkpoint inhibition has proved to be effective in several solid malignancies. The aim of this study was to identify novel targets for immunotherapy in anaplastic thyroid cancer by analysis of the expression of tumour antigens for which therapeutic agents are available.\nMETHOD AND RESULTS: By immunohistochemistry we observed tumoral expression of CD70 in 49% of cases. Expression of its receptor, CD27, was present mainly in lymphocytes surrounding and infiltrating the tumour and observed only rarely in tumour cells. CD70 expression was associated with the presence of a precursor papillary thyroid carcinoma and the presence of BRAF V600E mutations in the anaplastic thyroid cancer lesion. Furthermore, the expression of CD70 seems stable during progression of the disease. Tumoral expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) was found in 28.6% of the anaplastic thyroid cancer cases. Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), the receptor of PD-L1, was not expressed on the tumour cells. No association between CD70 expression and PD-L1 expression could be demonstrated.\nCONCLUSION: These data suggest that targeted immunotherapy for CD70/CD27 and PD-L1/PD-1 might be promising in anaplastic thyroid cancer. However, as a low amount of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes was observed in most lesions, combined therapy with agents enhancing the invasion of lymphocytes in the tumour region needs to be considered.","author":[{"family":"Zwaenepoel","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Jacobs","given":"Julie"},{"family":"De Meulenaere","given":"Astrid"},{"family":"Silence","given":"Karen"},{"family":"Smits","given":"Evelien"},{"family":"Siozopoulou","given":"Vasiliki"},{"family":"Hauben","given":"Esther"},{"family":"Rolfo","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Rottey","given":"Sylvie"},{"family":"Pauwels","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"zwaenepoelCD70PDL1Anaplastic2017","container-title":"Histopathology","container-title-short":"Histopathology","DOI":"10.1111/his.13230","ISSN":"1365-2559","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",9]]},"language":"eng","page":"357-365","PMID":"28383817","source":"PubMed","title":"CD70 and PD-L1 in anaplastic thyroid cancer - promising targets for immunotherapy","type":"article-journal","volume":"71"}
